## Notes for Implementation

### Content Licensing Considerations
- Official BACB documents are copyrighted but publicly available for educational use

- Cooper textbook content is copyrighted - use only for reference, not reproduction

### Content Processing Strategy
1. Start with official BACB PDFs (Task List, Ethics Code)
2. Supplement with free glossary definitions
3. Use domain breakdown for content organization
4. Generate questions aligned with TCO domain weights

### Question Distribution Target
Based on exam weights:
- Domain G (Behavior-Change Procedures): 14% of questions
- Domain B (Concepts and Principles): 14% of questions
- Domain E (Ethical Issues): 13% of questions
- Domain F (Behavior Assessment): 13% of questions
- Domain C (Measurement): 12% of questions
- Domain H (Interventions): 11% of questions
- Domain I (Supervision): 11% of questions
- Domain D (Experimental Design): 7% of questions
- Domain A (Behaviorism): 5% of questions
