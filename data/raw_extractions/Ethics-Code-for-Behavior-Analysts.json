    "text": "Introduction\nAs a diverse group of professionals who work in a variety of practice areas, behavior analysts deliver applied behavior\nanalysis (ABA) services to positively impact lives. The Behavior Analyst Certification Board® (BACB®) exists to meet the\ncredentialing needs of these professionals and relevant stakeholders (e.g., licensure boards, funders) while protecting ABA\nconsumers by establishing, disseminating, and managing professional standards. The BACB facilitates ethical behavior in the\nprofession through its certification eligibility and maintenance requirements, by issuing the ethics standards described in this\ndocument, and by operating a system for addressing professional misconduct.\nThe Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts (Code) guides the professional activities of behavior analysts over whom the BACB\nhas jurisdiction (see Scope of the Code below). The Code also provides a means for behavior analysts to evaluate their own\nbehavior and for others to assess whether a behavior analyst has violated their ethical obligations. An introduction section\ndescribes the scope and application of the Code, its core principles, and considerations for ethical decision making. The core\nprinciples are foundational concepts that should guide all aspects of a behavior analyst’s work. The introduction is followed\nby a glossary that includes definitions of technical terms used in the Code. The final section includes the ethics standards,\nwhich are informed by the core principles. The standards are organized into six sections: 1) Responsibility as a Professional,\n2) Responsibility in Practice, 3) Responsibility to Clients and Stakeholders, 4) Responsibility to Supervisees and Trainees, 5)\nResponsibility in Public Statements, and 6) Responsibility in Research.\nScope of the Code\nThe Code applies to all individuals who hold Board Certified Behavior Analyst® (BCBA®) or Board Certified Assistant Behavior\nAnalyst® (BCaBA®) certification and all individuals who have completed an application for BCBA or BCaBA certification. For the\nsake of efficiency, the term “behavior analyst” is used throughout this document to refer to those who must act in accordance\nwith the Code. The BACB does not have separate jurisdiction over organizations or corporations.\nThe Code applies to behavior analysts in all of their professional activities, including direct service delivery, consultation,\nsupervision, training, management, editorial and peer-review activities, research, and any other activity within the ABA\nprofession. The Code applies to behavior analysts’ professional activities across settings and delivery modes (e.g., in person;\nin writing; via phone, email, text message, video conferencing). Application of the Code does not extend to behavior analysts’\npersonal behavior unless it is determined that the behavior clearly poses a potential risk to the health and safety of clients,\nstakeholders, supervisees, or trainees.\nSpecific terms are defined in the Glossary section; however, two definitions are provided here because they are\nfrequently used in the Core Principles section.\nClient: The direct recipient of the behavior analyst’s services. At various times during service provision, one or\nmore stakeholders may simultaneously meet the definition of client (e.g., the point at which they receive direct\ntraining or consultation). In some contexts, the client might be a group of individuals (e.g., with organizational\nbehavior management services).\nStakeholder: An individual, other than the client, who is impacted by and invested in the behavior analyst’s\nservices (e.g., parent, caregiver, relative, legally authorized representative, collaborator, employer, agency or\ninstitutional representative, licensure board, funder, third-party contractor for services).\nUpdated 08/2024, Copyright © 2020, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "Core Principles\nFour foundational principles, which all behavior analysts should strive to embody, serve as the framework for the ethics\nstandards. Behavior analysts should use these principles to interpret and apply the standards in the Code. The four core\nprinciples are that behavior analysts should: benefit others; treat others with compassion, dignity, and respect; behave with\nintegrity; and ensure their own competence.\n1.

    "text": "Application of the Code\nBehavior analysts are expected to be knowledgeable about and comply with the Code and Code-Enforcement Procedures.\nLack of awareness or misunderstanding of an ethics standard is not a defense against an alleged ethics violation. When\nappropriate, behavior analysts should inform others about the Code and Code-Enforcement Procedures and create\nconditions that foster adherence to the Code. When addressing potential code violations by themselves or others, behavior\nanalysts document the steps taken and the resulting outcomes. Behavior analysts should address concerns about the\nprofessional misconduct of others directly with them when, after assessing the situation, it seems possible that doing so will\nresolve the issue and not place the behavior analyst or others at undue risk.\nThe BACB recognizes that behavior analysts may have different professional roles. As such, behavior analysts are\nrequired to comply with all applicable laws, licensure requirements, codes of conduct/ethics, reporting requirements (e.g.,\nmandated reporting, reporting to funding sources or licensure board, self-reporting to the BACB, reporting instances of\nmisrepresentation by others), and professional practice requirements related to their various roles. In some instances,\nbehavior analysts may need to report serious concerns to relevant authorities or agencies that can provide more immediate\nrelief or protection before reporting to the BACB (e.g., criminal activity or behavior that places clients or others at risk for\ndirect and immediate harm should immediately be reported to the relevant authorities before reporting to the BACB or a\nlicensure board).\nThe standards included in the Code are not meant to be exhaustive, as it is impossible to predict every situation that might\nconstitute an ethics violation. Therefore, the absence of a particular behavior or type of conduct from the Code standards\ndoes not indicate that such behavior or conduct is ethical or unethical. When interpreting and applying a standard, it is critical\nto attend to its specific wording and function, as well as the core principles. Additionally, standards must be applied to a\nsituation using a functional, contextualized approach that accounts for factors relevant to that situation, such as variables\nrelated to diversity (e.g., age, disability, ethnicity, gender expression/identity, immigration status, marital/relationship status,\nnational origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status) and possible imbalances in power. In all instances\nof interpreting and applying the Code, behavior analysts should put compliance with the law and clients’ interests first by\nactively working to maximize desired outcomes and minimize risk.\nEthical decision making. Behavior analysts will likely encounter complex and multifaceted ethical dilemmas. When faced with\nsuch a dilemma, behavior analysts should identify problems and solutions with care and deliberation. In resolving an ethical\ndilemma, behavior analysts should follow the spirit and letter of the Code’s core principles and specific standards. Behavior\nanalysts should address ethical dilemmas through a structured decision-making process that considers the full context of the\nsituation and the function of relevant ethics standards. Although no single ethical decision-making process will be equally\neffective in all situations, the process below illustrates a systematic approach behavior analysts can take to document and\naddress potential ethical concerns.\nThroughout all of the following steps, document information that may be essential to decision making or for\ncommunicating the steps taken and outcomes (e.g., to the BACB, licensure boards, or other governing agencies).\nFor example, consider documenting: dates, times, locations, and relevant individuals; summaries of observations,\nmeetings, or information reported by others. Take care to protect confidentiality in the preparation and storage of all\ndocumentation.\n1. Clearly define the issue and consider potential risk of harm to relevant individuals.\n2. Identify all relevant individuals.\n3. Gather relevant supporting documentation and follow-up on second-hand information to confirm that there is an\nactual ethical concern.\n4. Consider your personal learning history and biases in the context of the relevant individuals.\n5. Identify the relevant core principles and Code standards.\n6. Consult available resources (e.g., research, decision-making models, trusted colleagues).\n7. Develop several possible actions to reduce or remove risk of harm, prioritizing the best interests of clients in\naccordance with the Code and applicable laws.\nUpdated 08/2024, Copyright © 2020, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "Ethics Standards\nSection 1—Responsibility as a Professional\n1.01 Being Truthful\nBehavior analysts are truthful and arrange the professional environment to promote truthful behavior in others. They do\nnot create professional situations that result in others engaging in behavior that is fraudulent or illegal or that violates the\nCode. They also provide truthful and accurate information to all required entities (e.g., BACB, licensure boards, funders)\nand individuals (e.g., clients, stakeholders, supervisees, trainees), and they correct instances of untruthful or inaccurate\nsubmissions as soon as they become aware of them.\n1.02 Conforming with Legal and Professional Requirements\nBehavior analysts follow the law and the requirements of their professional community (e.g., BACB, licensure board).\n1.03 Accountability\nBehavior analysts are accountable for their actions and professional services and follow through on work commitments. When\nerrors occur or commitments cannot be met, behavior analysts take all appropriate actions to directly address them, first in\nthe best interest of clients, and then in the best interest of relevant parties.\n1.04 Practicing within a Defined Role\nBehavior analysts provide services only after defining and documenting their professional role with relevant parties in writing.\n1.05 Practicing within Scope of Competence\nBehavior analysts practice only within their identified scope of competence. They engage in professional activities in\nnew areas (e.g., populations, procedures) only after accessing and documenting appropriate study, training, supervised\nexperience, consultation, and/or co-treatment from professionals competent in the new area. Otherwise, they refer or\ntransition services to an appropriate professional.\n1.06 Maintaining Competence\nBehavior analysts actively engage in professional development activities to maintain and further their professional\ncompetence. Professional development activities include reading relevant literature; attending conferences and conventions;\nparticipating in workshops and other training opportunities; obtaining additional coursework; receiving coaching, consultation,\nsupervision, or mentorship; and obtaining and maintaining appropriate professional credentials.\n1.07 Cultural Responsiveness and Diversity\nBehavior analysts actively engage in professional development activities to acquire knowledge and skills related to cultural\nresponsiveness and diversity. They evaluate their own biases and ability to address the needs of individuals with diverse needs/\nbackgrounds (e.g., age, disability, ethnicity, gender expression/identity, immigration status, marital/relationship status, national\norigin, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status). Behavior analysts also evaluate biases of their supervisees and\ntrainees, as well as their supervisees’ and trainees’ ability to address the needs of individuals with diverse needs/backgrounds.\n1.08 Nondiscrimination\nBehavior analysts do not discriminate against others. They behave toward others in an equitable and inclusive manner\nregardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender expression/identity, immigration status, marital/relationship status, national\norigin, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or any other basis proscribed by law.\n1.09 Nonharassment\nBehavior analysts do not engage in behavior that is harassing or hostile toward others.\n1.10 Awareness of Personal Biases and Challenges\nBehavior analysts maintain awareness that their personal biases or challenges (e.g., mental or physical health conditions;\nlegal, financial, marital/relationship challenges) may interfere with the effectiveness of their professional work. Behavior\nanalysts take appropriate steps to resolve interference, ensure that their professional work is not compromised, and\ndocument all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes.\nUpdated 08/2024, Copyright © 2020, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "1.11 Multiple Relationships\nBecause multiple relationships may result in a conflict of interest that might harm one or more parties, behavior analysts\navoid entering into or creating multiple relationships, including professional, personal, and familial relationships with clients\nand colleagues. Behavior analysts communicate the risks of multiple relationships to relevant individuals and continually\nmonitor for the development of multiple relationships. If multiple relationships arise, behavior analysts take appropriate steps\nto resolve them. When immediately resolving a multiple relationship is not possible, behavior analysts develop appropriate\nsafeguards to identify and avoid conflicts of interest in compliance with the Code and develop a plan to eventually resolve\nthe multiple relationship. Behavior analysts document all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes.\n1.12 Giving and Receiving Gifts\nBecause the exchange of gifts can invite conflicts of interest and multiple relationships, behavior analysts do not give gifts to\nor accept gifts from clients, stakeholders, supervisees, or trainees with a monetary value of more than $10 US dollars (or the\nequivalent purchasing power in another currency). Behavior analysts make clients and stakeholders aware of this requirement\nat the onset of the professional relationship. A gift is acceptable if it functions as an infrequent expression of gratitude and\ndoes not result in financial benefit to the recipient. Instances of giving or accepting ongoing or cumulative gifts may rise to the\nlevel of a violation of this standard if the gifts become a regularly expected source of income or value to the recipient.\n1.13 Coercive and Exploitative Relationships\nBehavior analysts do not abuse their power or authority by coercing or exploiting persons over whom they have authority\n(e.g., evaluative, supervisory).\n1.14 Romantic and Sexual Relationships\nBehavior analysts do not engage in romantic or sexual relationships with current clients, stakeholders, trainees, or\nsupervisees because such relationships pose a substantial risk of conflicts of interest and impaired judgment.

When recommending and implementing restrictive or punishment-based\nprocedures, behavior analysts comply with any required review processes (e.g., a human rights review committee). Behavior\nanalysts must continually evaluate and document the effectiveness of restrictive or punishment-based procedures and modify\nor discontinue the behavior-change intervention in a timely manner if it is ineffective.\n2.16 Describing Behavior-Change Interventions Before Implementation\nBefore implementation, behavior analysts describe in writing the objectives and procedures of the behavior-change\nintervention, any projected timelines, and the schedule of ongoing review.

They make appropriate efforts to prevent accidental or inadvertent sharing of confidential or identifying information\nwhile conducting research and in any dissemination activity related to the research (e.g., disguising or removing confidential\nor identifying information).\n6.06 Competence in Conducting Research (see 1.04, 1.05, 1.06, 3.01)\nBehavior analysts only conduct research independently after they have successfully conducted research under a supervisor\nin a defined relationship (e.g., thesis, dissertation, mentored research project). Behavior analysts and their assistants are\npermitted to perform only those research activities for which they are appropriately trained and prepared. Before engaging\nin research activities for which a behavior analyst has not received training, they seek the appropriate training and become\ndemonstrably competent or they collaborate with other professionals who have the required competence. Behavior analysts\nare responsible for the ethical conduct of all personnel assigned to the research project.\n6.07 Conflict of Interest in Research and Publication (see 1.01, 1.11, 1.13)\nWhen conducting research, behavior analysts identify, disclose, and address conflicts of interest (e.g., personal, financial,\norganization related, service related). They also identify, disclose, and address conflicts of interest in their publication and\neditorial activities.\n6.08 Appropriate Credit (see 1.01, 1.11, 1.13)\nBehavior analysts give appropriate credit (e.g., authorship, author-note acknowledgment) to research contributors in all\ndissemination activities. Authorship and other publication acknowledgments accurately reflect the relative scientific or\nprofessional contributions of the individuals involved, regardless of their professional status (e.g., professor, student).\n6.09 Plagiarism (see 1.01)\nBehavior analysts do not present portions or elements of another’s work or data as their own. Behavior analysts only\nrepublish their previously published data or text when accompanied by proper disclosure.\n6.10 Documentation and Data Retention in Research (see 2.03, 2.05, 3.11, 4.05)\nBehavior analysts must be knowledgeable about and comply with all applicable standards (e.g., BACB rules, laws, research\nreview committee requirements) for storing, transporting, retaining, and destroying physical and electronic documentation\nrelated to research. They retain identifying documentation and data for the longest required duration. Behavior analysts\ndestroy physical documentation after making deidentified digital copies or summaries of data (e.g., reports and graphs) when\npermitted by relevant entities.\n6.11 Accuracy and Use of Data (see 1.01, 2.17, 5.03)\nBehavior analysts do not fabricate data or falsify results in their research, publications, and presentations. They plan and carry\nout their research and describe their procedures and findings to minimize the possibility that their research and results will\nbe misleading or misinterpreted. If they discover errors in their published data they take steps to correct them by following\npublisher policy. Data from research projects are presented to the public and scientific community in their entirety whenever\npossible. When that is not possible, behavior analysts take caution and explain the exclusion of data (whether single data\npoints, or partial or whole data sets) from presentations or manuscripts submitted for publication by providing a rationale and\ndescription of what was excluded.\nUpdated 08/2024, Copyright © 2020, BACB® | All rights reserved.
