    "text": "OvErvIEw\nOverview\nAbout the Behavior Analyst Certification Board\nThe Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc.® (BACB®) has been the leader in behavior analyst certification for over\ntwo decades. The BACB is a nonprofit corporation that was established in 1998 to meet professional certification\nneeds identified by behavior analysts, governments, and consumers of behavior-analytic services. The BACB’s\nmission is to protect consumers of behavior-analytic services by systematically establishing, promoting, and\ndisseminating professional standards of practice.\nIn the profession of applied behavior analysis, the BACB’s primary role is to operate certification programs, which\ninvolves responsibilities similar to regulatory boards. In this role, the BACB establishes practice standards, administers\nexaminations, and provides ethics requirements and a disciplinary system for each of its certification programs. To\nlearn more about our role and limitations, read our blog post, The BACB: What it is, What it Does, and Why, and listen\nto Episode 11 of our podcast, Inside the BACB.\nWhat Is a Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst?\nThe Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst (BCaBA) is an undergraduate-level certification in behavior analysis.\nProfessionals certified at the BCaBA level provide behavior-analytic services under the supervision of a Board\nCertified Behavior Analyst (BCBA).\nProfessionals certified at the BCaBA level may not provide behavior-analytic services without the supervision of a\nBCBA. BCaBAs may supervise the work of Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs).\nJurisdiction\nThe BACB currently accepts certification applications from individuals regardless of their country of residence.\nEffective January 1, 2023, only individuals who reside in the US, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom* may\napply for BACB certification.\nAccreditation\nThe BCBA®, BCaBA®, and RBT® certification programs are accredited by the National Commission\nfor Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the accreditation body of the Institute for Credentialing Excellence\n(ICE). NCCA’s Standards for the Accreditation of Certification Programs were the first standards\ndeveloped for professional certification programs to help ensure the health, welfare, and safety of\nthe public. NCCA standards articulate the essential elements of a high-quality certification program.\nConsistent with these standards, the BACB’s certification requirements, examination content, and\nprocedures undergo regular review by subject matter experts in the discipline. To learn more about\naccreditation, see ICE’s video, Value of Accreditation: Why it Matters.\n* Individuals who reside in the UK may continue to apply for BACB certification through 2025. This date may be moved earlier\nif the UK Society for Behaviour Analysis seeks national recognition for UK behavior analysts, develops its own credentialing\nsystem, and transitions current BACB certificants into the UK system.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "OvErvIEw\nReasons for Becoming a BCaBA\nThere are many benefits to obtaining BCaBA certification, including:\n• BCaBA certification is the leading assistant behavior analyst credential and is required by many funders\nand licensure boards. BCaBA certification is offered by the first certifying entity in behavior analysis, the\nBACB, which has been certifying behavior analysts for over 20 years.\n• BCaBA certification shows that you have met certain requirements that are critical in providing behavioranalytic services under the supervision of a BCBA.\n• BCaBA certification provides increased consumer protection since you must meet certain eligibility and\nmaintenance requirements to obtain and maintain certification.\n• BCaBA certification makes it easier for employers, funders, and consumers, among others, to verify that\nyou have certain knowledge, skills, and abilities and are not under disciplinary sanctions.\nYou Want to Pursue Certification… Now What?*\nSo, you are interested in pursuing BCaBA certification. What should you do now? Although the BACB cannot\ninstruct you on how to meet our requirements, the content in this section is intended to provide some guidance\nthat might be helpful as you start this journey.\nA Few Tips Before Getting Started\nFirst, carefully review both the eligibility and maintenance requirements that are detailed in this handbook.\nSecond, determine when you might apply. Keep in mind that it may take a few years to meet all of the\nrequirements, so you might not qualify to apply until after January 1, 2022. At that time, you must meet the\neligibility and examination requirements described in the BCaBA 2022 Eligibility Requirements document. You\nshould use the BCaBA 2022 Eligibility Requirements document—not this handbook—to ensure that you meet all\nof the requirements.\nThird, you will want to create a BACB account using these tips:\n• Enter your full name exactly as it appears on your government-issued identification. If it does not match\nexactly, you will not be able to take the examination. Name changes require review by BACB staff, so a\nname change could delay your ability to take the examination.\n• Use a personal email address and not a work or school email address. Important notifications and\nreminders are sent to this address, so if you switch employers or lose access to your school email\naddress, you will not receive reminders, correspondence, or password resets.\n• Set up the profile yourself and do not share your account information with anyone else, including your\nemployer. This is your certification—no one else should be managing it for you.\n• Update your information in your BACB account as soon as changes occur (e.g., name change,\naddress change).\nCreating a BACB account will give you a BACB account ID number, which you will need to add to documents as\nyou work toward certification. Having a BACB account also means that you will receive important updates from\nthe BACB.\n* This is not a comprehensive resource for all activities you will need to or should complete as you prepare for certification.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "OvErvIEw\nConsiderations When Exploring Training Options\nYou only receive your initial training once. If possible, don’t pick your training out of convenience, expense,\nor geography. We recommend thoroughly researching the trainings before committing to one. While we can’t\nprovide guidance on where to receive your behavior-analytic coursework, here are some things to consider.\nIdeally, you should obtain your education in behavior analysis from a behavior-analytic degree program. There are\nmany benefits to this option. For instance, in most cases, you can meet all BCaBA eligibility requirements in one place\nwhile also having engaging, non-classroom interactions with behavior-analytic faculty and students that will greatly\nenhance your education and begin to develop your behavior-analytic social networks. Even if you don’t receive all of\nyour supervised experience through the degree-granting program, your faculty will likely help you identify where you\ncan accrue your hours in an immersive behavior-analytic environment. If completing your education in a behavioranalytic degree program is a possibility for you, here are a few things to consider as you research programs.\nFirst, research the faculty members and determine whether the program’s interest(s) align with yours (see the\nABA Subspecialty Resources on the About Behavior Analysis web page for some of the areas in which behavior\nanalysis has been applied). Second, identify the program’s structure to determine how much time you will\nhave with your faculty and fellow students. Third, confirm that the program has a pathway to meet the BACB’s\ncoursework requirements.\nYou may obtain your behavior-analytic coursework through one of two sources: an Association for Behavior\nAnalysis International (ABAI) accredited undergraduate program or a Verified Course Sequence.\n• ABAI-Accredited Undergraduate Program: Behavior-analytic undergraduate programs that have been\naccredited by ABAI have met ABAI’s accreditation standards, which include standards for the curriculum,\nfaculty, and resources, among other areas. Accredited programs may be found on ABAI’s Accredited\nPrograms web page. Note: If you apply after January 1, 2022, using an undergraduate degree from an\nABAI-accredited program, both the coursework and degree eligibility requirements will be met.\n• Verified Course Sequence: The other option for completing behavior-analytic coursework is through a\nVerified Course Sequence. A Verified Course Sequence is a set of courses that have been verified by\nABAI as having met the BACB’s behavior-analytic coursework requirements. Although some Verified\nCourse Sequences are embedded in an ABAI-accredited undergraduate program, many are not. Verified\nCourse Sequence status merely indicates that the content-hour requirements for certain behavioranalytic courses have been reviewed. Verified Course Sequences may be located using ABAI’s Verified\nCourse Sequence Directory.\nFinally, when determining where to obtain your coursework, you might also want to consider:\n• Program Focus: Do you have any existing areas of interest? If so, does the program align with your\nprofessional goals? Is the program led by faculty with similar interests? Will the program help facilitate\nexperience in areas that are meaningful to you?\n• Program Size: Find out the size of each cohort and determine if the size is a good fit for you as a learner.\nThis information can usually be found on the program’s website. Our university pass rate documents also\ngive an idea of program size by looking at the number of candidates who took the examination from an\ninstitution each year (see the Sort by Volume section of the document).\n• Program Structure: Courses are usually taught on campus, online, or in a combination of online and\non-campus experiences (again, this information should be available on the program’s website). Consider\nwhat structure is the best fit for you as a learner. You might want to consider what has worked for you in\nthe past. Were you successful in online courses? Did you need or value in-person experiences? In what\nsetting did you learn the most and feel the most engaged?\n• Number of Faculty: Determine how many part- and full-time faculty are on staff, especially in relation to\nthe program size, to understand the student-to-faculty ratio.\n• University Pass Rates: The BACB annually publishes examination pass rate data for universities with\nVerified Course Sequences. Passing the BCaBA examination is not the most important part of your\ntraining, but, at a minimum, your training should prepare you to pass the examination.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "OvErvIEw\nOnce you have identified where you will get your behavior-analytic coursework, your faculty mentor/advisor,\nprogram chair, and/or Verified Course Sequence Coordinator will be your resource to help you meet the BACB’s\nrequirements along the way.\nConsiderations When Identifying Practical Experience Opportunities\nHold on! Remember that qualifying behavior-analytic coursework needs to begin before experience, so make\nsure you get your coursework situation figured out beforehand. Once you have started your coursework,\ndetermine where you want to accrue your structured experience hours and whether it will give you the applied\nexperience that will prepare you to practice after you are certified. For instance, consider the population(s)\nand setting(s) where you want to ultimately provide behavior-analytic services. The BACB cannot provide this\nguidance, so you should reach out to your Verified Course Sequence Coordinator, advisor, or employer for\nguidance about where to accrue experience in your chosen area.\nWhen identifying supervisor(s) to oversee your experience hours, ensure that they are qualified to be your\nsupervisor (see the Experience Requirements section). In addition, you should focus on finding supervisors\nwho have a successful track record of BACB supervision. You could do this in a number of ways, but here are a\nfew ideas:\n• Check on their certification status in the Certificant Registry to ensure that they are qualified to supervise\nand to see if they have any disciplinary sanctions.\n• Look at how long they have been certified. We recommend identifying supervisors who have been\ncertified for at least a year, if not longer.\n• Gather information from the supervisor and past supervisees about the supervisor’s style to make sure\nthey are a good fit for you.\n• Ask about their time and document-management systems. Caution: If you can’t produce all of the\nnecessary documents to support your experience in the event of an audit, you might lose experience\nhours, so you will want a very organized supervisor!\n• Determine whether they are familiar with the BACB’s requirements.\n• Consider whether they could customize the experience to your interests (while still meeting their ethical\nobligations as a BCBA to stay within their area of competence).\nOnce you have identified experience site(s) and supervisor(s), complete the Pre-Experience Checklist before\nyou get started with each experience site/supervisor. The BACB is not able to provide guidance beyond what\nis in our experience requirements, as each situation is unique (e.g., whether a specific activity will qualify toward\nyour experience hours). Work together with your supervisor(s) to ensure that you are meeting the experience\nrequirements while also meeting your professional goals.\nA Few Final Tips\nKeep this handbook handy. We will update the handbook quarterly as needed, so always make sure that you are\nreviewing the most current handbook to see what has changed since the last version. It is also important that you\nbecome familiar with all applicable licensure requirements in your area.\nGet involved and engaged with your behavior-analytic community! This might include joining or volunteering\nwith your local, regional, or national professional associations and groups focused in your area(s) of interest.\nYou will likely learn a lot and have an opportunity to contribute to behavior analysis and its consumers.\nHaving professional support is helpful at every stage of your career, so create opportunities to identify trusted\ncolleague(s), mentors, and/or groups now.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

Pre-Experience\n• Start your qualifying coursework. Checklist\n• Locate an appropriate supervisor.\n• Confirm that your supervisor is qualified to supervise using the\nCertificant Registry and the Supervisor Requirements section.\n• Complete a supervision contract with your supervisor (the BACB provides a\nsample supervision contract that you can use as a comparison to make sure\nall of the relevant content is included).\n• Develop a system for storing experience-related documents.\n• Create your own documentation system to capture information showing\nthat you met the requirements.\n• Avoid storing experience documents (e.g., M-EVFs, F-EVFs) where\naccess could be limited (e.g., a work computer).\n• Plan your experience.\nExperience Tip Sheet\n• Remember that experience must be completed within a five-year period.\n• Determine when you expect to submit a BCaBA Certification Application. If it is near or after January\n1, 2022, ensure that you are meeting the fi eldwork requirements and all other eligibility requirements\nin effect at that time. You might also want to review the Guidance for Those Applying for BCaBA\nCertification during the 2022 Transition document if you are unsure whether you will apply before or\nafter January 1, 2022.\nDuring Your Experience:\n• Keep your personal contact information up to date in your BACB account. Make changes to contact\ninformation (legal name, email address, phone number, mailing address) in your BACB account\nwhen necessary.\n• Remain current on changes to certification requirements by reading BACB Newsletters and reviewing the\nBACB website (including podcasts and blogs).\n• Ensure that you are continuing to meet the experience requirements.\n• Complete and sign (you and your supervisor) your M-EVFs for each supervisory period.\n• M-EVFs need to be signed within one month of the close of the supervisory period, but you and\nyour supervisor are strongly encouraged to sign the M-EVF immediately at the close of each\nsupervisory period.\n• The forms may contain drop-down menus, so we recommend completing them electronically.\nSubmission of incomplete or unclear forms may delay the processing of your application.\n• Ensure that your documentation system provides evidence that you are meeting the experience requirements.\nConcluding Experience With a Supervisor or Organization:\n• Complete and sign the F-EVF(s) upon completion of experience with a given supervisor or organization.\n• The total hours on your F-EVF(s) may not exceed the sum of the hours on your M-EVFs.\n• Make sure that the names and BACB account ID numbers you provide on your EVFs are identical to\nhow they appear in your BACB account.\n• Retain experience documents for at least seven years.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

This restriction is designed to ensure that trainees have sufficient time to\nacquire the other skills necessary for practice as a BCaBA. Restricted activities may comprise no more than 50% of\nthe total experience hours—this requirement does not need to be met during each supervisory period. Please note\nthat this restriction does not necessarily refer to all time spent working with clients.\nUnrestricted Activities: Activities that are unrestricted are those that best exemplify the work of a behavior analyst\nwho develops programs and systems for others to implement. Unrestricted activities must comprise at least 50% of\nthe total experience hours—this requirement does not need to be met during each supervisory period. Examples of\nunrestricted activities include:\n• observation and data collection\n• training staff and caregivers on behavior-analytic programs or content\n• conducting assessments related to the need for behavioral intervention\n• meeting with clients about behavior-analytic programming and services\n• conducting behavior-analytic assessments (e.g., functional analyses, stimulus preference assessments)\n• data graphing and analysis\n• researching the literature relevant to a current client’s programming\n• writing and revising behavior-analytic programs\nWhy are unrestricted activities so important?\nFollowing certification, most behavior analysts primarily perform unrestricted activities. It is\nimportant, therefore, to have experience with these activities before becoming certified.\nUnacceptable Activities: Only behavior-analytic activities may be counted toward experience requirements.\nNonbehavior-analytic activities, while valuable, may not be counted. Examples of activities that will not count as\nexperience include:\n• attending meetings with little or no behavior-analytic content\n• providing interventions that are not based in behavior analysis\n• performing nonbehavioral administrative activities\n• nonbehavior-analytic trainings related to service delivery (e.g., crisis management, CPR, billing systems)\n• completing nonbehavioral assessments (e.g., diagnostic assessments, intellectual assessments), paperwork,\ndocumentation, billing, or any other activities that are not directly related to behavior analysis\n• attending professional conferences, workshops, or university courses\n• didactic-course assignments (e.g., completing homework assignments, readings)\nCan the BACB tell me if an activity counts toward my experience hours?\nUnfortunately not. Since every trainee’s goals are unique—and we cannot possibly know\nor anticipate all of the situational variables, populations, and settings in which they may be\nworking—we cannot provide guidance beyond our certification requirements. We rely on qualified\nsupervisors to determine how to develop practical experiences that meet our requirements and\nbest support clients’ needs and trainees’ goals.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

The number of trainees in a group meeting may\nnot exceed 10 at any time, regardless of the number of supervisors in the meeting. If If you have started\nnontrainees are present, their participation should be limited, and their presence must qualifying coursework\nnot inhibit discussion or interfere with participation by trainees. The amount of group for BCBA certification\nsupervision may not exceed the amount of individual supervision in a given supervisory and if all of your hours\nperiod. In other words, supervision may be conducted in groups for no more than half are accrued within a\nof the total supervised hours in each supervisory period.

BCaBA and BCBA\n• Observation-With-Client Requirements: The trainee must be observed working with certification.\na client in the natural environment during each supervisory period by at least one\nsupervisor. In-person, on-site observation is preferred. However, the observation may\nbe conducted using asynchronous (e.g., recorded video) or synchronous (e.g., live\nvideo conference) formats.\nPlease refer to the A Comparison of Experience Types table for information about supervision contacts and\nobservations with clients and how these differ across the experience types.\nCan a supervision contact and an observation occur at the same time?\nIf your supervisor observes you with a client and provides you with immediate, real-time\nfeedback, it could meet both requirements. However, if your supervisor observes you with a client\nand doesn’t give you feedback on the interaction until the following day, the supervision contact\nand observation are considered to have occurred at different times.\nAmount of Supervision: Based on the type of experience hours accrued, you will need to have 5% (Supervised\nIndependent Fieldwork), 7.5% (Practicum), or 10% (Intensive Practicum) of your hours supervised by a qualified\nsupervisor each supervisory period. The supervision percentage is calculated by dividing supervised hours by total\nexperience hours (i.e., independent and supervised hours).\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

This experience type is only\navailable within a Verified Course Sequence with Verified Experience and requires enrollment in a practicum\ncourse with a passing grade.

Trainees must meet all other supervision\nrequirements independently. For example, the required percentage of supervision, number of observations, and\nnumber of contacts must be met independently for each experience type. Trainees must also meet the requirements\nfor each organized experience (i.e., for each M-EVF and F-EVF). For example, if a trainee is accruing some hours with\nan individual supervisor at one setting and also accruing hours at another organization where multiple supervisors\nare overseeing their hours, then the trainee must meet the requirements at both sites.\nPartial Months: Some experience requirements (e.g., number of contacts) may need to be prorated in instances\nwhere a trainee does not work a full calendar month (e.g., four contacts were required, but only two weeks of\nexperience were accrued within the month). The BACB does not provide formulas for prorating every instance where\nthere may be a deviation in the calculation of the supervisory period. Instead, it is the responsibility of the supervisor\nto determine how best to prorate the experience. In the event of an audit, the BACB will require evidence of how the\nsupervisor prorated the experience (and all associated requirements) to ensure the partial experience was compliant\nwith these standards.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "ELIgIBILITy rEqUIrEmENTS\nDisputes About Experience Verification Form Signatures\nDisputes that occur during supervisory relationships should first be addressed directly between the supervisor\nand the trainee. If there is an ethics violation related to the experience, the trainee may report the matter to the\nBACB by filing a Notice of Alleged Violation. Note: A Notice of Alleged Violation may only be submitted against\nsomeone who has applied for BACB certification.\nTrainees may submit a Contested Experience/Fieldwork Form when the supervisor refuses or is unable to sign\nthe F-EVF even though all supervision-contract terms have been met. Submission of a Contested Experience/\nFieldwork Form may involve an experience audit. Disputes over signing M-EVFs should be handled between\nsupervisors and trainees. In the event of a contractual dispute, issues may need to be addressed through an\nappropriate independent legal process.\nTips for Preventing Disputes Between Supervisors and Trainees\nA supervisor may feel justified in not signing a trainee’s F-EVF or M-EVF even though the trainee may believe\nthat they are entitled to the signature. Although it is impossible to eliminate the likelihood of disputes about\nsupervised experience hours, there are ways to mitigate that risk. The following guidance might be helpful:\n• Before the supervisory relationship begins, trainees and supervisors should review the supervision\ncontract and BACB requirements together and clarify expectations. Specifically, supervisors should\nidentify conditions under which they will and will not sign a trainee’s F-EVF or M-EVF, as well as situations\nthat could end the supervisory relationship.\n• Supervision should adhere to BACB ethics requirements as described in the Code. It should be behavior\nanalytic and effectively and ethically designed to meet the requirements for certification; supervisors\nshould communicate conditions with trainees before beginning supervision, including evaluation\ncriteria and supervision terms; and supervisors should provide documented, timely feedback about\ntrainee performance.\n• Supervisors should be familiar with BACB supervision requirements and provide supervised experience\naccordingly. This is an ethics requirement for all supervisors and will help ensure that trainees can count\ntheir hours when applying for certification.\n• Before the end of the supervisory relationship, supervisors should take the steps necessary to avoid\nabandoning their trainees. This includes discussing relevant client services and transition needs with\ntheir trainees; organizing, gathering, and signing supervision documentation; and, if appropriate, helping\nto facilitate a timely transfer of responsibility to another supervisor.\nGuidance in the Event of a Dispute\nThe BACB’s contested-experience/fieldwork process was developed to help resolve supervisor/trainee\ndisagreements about signing F-EVFs. Based on past contested-experience/fieldwork cases filed with the BACB,\nthe following are the most common issues we have encountered—along with some guidance:\n• Accuracy of Information on EVFs: Under the Code, a supervisor may not submit or allow the submission\nof false or misleading information and has an obligation to correct inaccurate information submitted to the\nBACB. If a contested-experience/fieldwork case is filed with the BACB that alleges inaccurate information,\nsupporting documentation should clearly identify how the information is inaccurate and outline the efforts\ntaken to correct the inaccuracies.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "ELIgIBILITy rEqUIrEmENTS\n• Questions About a Trainee’s Competence After Concluding Supervision: Under the Code, if a\nsupervisor questions a trainee’s competence after supervision has ended, they must provide sufficient\ndocumentation of feedback given to the trainee about performance issues, along with training and\nretraining efforts that occurred during the supervisory period. In other words, supervisors should not\nquestion competence after the conclusion of supervision without clear evidence showing they provided\nperformance-based feedback during the supervised experience.\n• Business Disputes Over Supervision Service Payments: Should a trainee refuse to pay for supervision\nservices, supervisors should seek enforcement of the supervision contract through the appropriate\nvenue (e.g., lawsuit, arbitration, mediation). Supervisors should not withhold signatures on EVFs until\nthey receive payment. If a trainee demonstrates that supervision occurred in accordance with BACB\nrequirements, we will allow the hours to be counted.\n• Potential Ethics Violations Discovered After Concluding Supervision: If potential ethics violations are\ndiscovered following the conclusion of supervision, report the alleged violation immediately through\none of the BACB’s reporting options. If there is a serious risk of harm to a consumer, follow all applicable\nmandated-reporting requirements in addition to reporting to the BACB. Note: A Notice of Alleged\nViolation may only be submitted against someone who has applied for BACB certification.\n• Potential Supervisor Ethics Violations Discovered: The trainee should review the Reporting an Alleged\nViolation section of the BACB website to determine whether submitting a Notice of Alleged Violation is\nappropriate (see the Considerations for Reporting an Alleged Violation Against a BCaBA/BCBA).\nSupervisors contemplating not signing an EVF should determine if (a) not signing is appropriate, (b) they\ndelineated the conditions for not signing an EVF in the supervision contract, and (c) they have sufficient\ndocumentation to justify withholding their signature. Trainees who contest a signature denial must be prepared to\ndemonstrate that the denial violates BACB requirements and that they have tried to resolve the situation with the\nsupervisor first.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "ExAmINATION\nExamination\nThe BCaBA certification examination is based on the results of a formal job task analysis. The BACB follows nationally\naccepted standards for test development that include the use of subject matter experts and extensive surveys.\nThe purpose of the BCaBA certification examination is to assess knowledge of the BCaBA Task List (4th ed.) at a level\nconsistent with that of an entry-level assistant behavior analyst. The BCaBA certification examination comprises 140\nmultiple-choice questions, 10 of which are unscored pilot items. Each question has 4 possible answers. Candidates\nhave 4 hours to complete the examination.\nThe BCaBA certification examination is only available at authorized Pearson VUE testing sites worldwide that\nmeet the security requirements necessary for administration of high-stakes examinations. The BACB currently has\nauthorized the availability of testing sites in multiple countries and evaluates the addition of new sites routinely and\nby requests made through Pearson VUE’s website.\nThe examinations are administered using a computer-based testing (CBT) format by Pearson VUE. Pearson VUE’s\nwebsite offers:\n• a tutorial to become familiar with the CBT format,\n• information about what to expect at a Pearson VUE testing center, and\n• examination locations and testing centers.\nScoring\nThe BACB uses the modified Angoff method for establishing the passing score for each base examination form. New\nbase examination forms are created approximately every five years or whenever there is a significant change to the\nexamination content, such as the introduction of a new task list. The BACB maintains a large pool of questions that\ncan be used to generate many different forms of the examination that are equated to the base examination.\nThe modified Angoff method is criterion referenced, meaning that the passing score for each base examination is\nestablished by a panel of BACB-certified subject matter experts and then approved by the BACB Board of Directors.\nYour performance on the examination is not dependent on the performance of those taking the examination with you.\nThe BACB is committed to reporting uncompromised and valid examination scores. On rare occasions, circumstances\nmay invalidate examination scores. The BACB reserves the right to cancel or withhold examination scores due to\nsuspected or documented misconduct during testing at a Pearson VUE site or violation of the Professional and\nEthical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts. Invalidation may also occur due to situations beyond your control—or\nthat of the BACB’s—at the testing site. Should this occur, you are encouraged to submit an administrative appeal.\nPreparation\nContent on the BCaBA Task List (4th ed.) serves as the basis of the examination. Although the BACB cannot\nendorse specific study guides or other preparation materials, we do recommend that candidates review the task list,\nmaterials from their training, and the Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts and study the\ncontent areas.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

This process includes security measures,\nsuch as photographing, fingerprinting, and obtaining an electronic signature from each candidate. Once an\nexamination has been underway for 30 minutes, no candidates will be admitted to the examination area.\n• You must provide two forms of valid identification to be admitted into the examination area. Both pieces of\nidentification must show your first and last name exactly as they appear on your BACB account. Any name\ndiscrepancies will prevent admission to the examination (e.g., providing a nickname on your BACB account,\nidentification that shows a different last name due to marriage). Pearson VUE does not make exceptions to\nname discrepancies based on marriage certificates.\n• Both pieces of identification must have your signature and be current (i.e., not expired). The primary\nidentification must be government issued and include both a photo and signature (e.g., a driver’s license or\nstate/national ID). The secondary identification must include a signature but need not include a photo (e.g., a\nsigned credit card with a signature that matches the government-issued identification).\n• Failure to present two fully valid pieces of identification will prevent your admission to the testing center. If\nthis happens, you will be marked absent and will forfeit the entire examination fee.\n• No cameras, phones, recording devices, beepers or electronic transmitting devices, notes or reference\nmaterials, books, briefcases, backpacks, portfolios, purses, etc. may be taken into the examination area.\nPersonal items may be stored in lockers available at all testing centers.\n• Scratch paper, calculators, rulers, textbooks, reference materials, and notes are NOT permitted in the\nexamination area, and you are not allowed to remove any examination materials from the administration\nroom. A dry-erase board will be provided at each workstation.\n• Earplugs are available upon request at all testing centers, some of which also provide noise-canceling\nheadphones upon request.\n• No food or beverage items are permitted in the examination area.\n• No visitors are permitted in the examination area.\n• If you leave the examination area to use the restroom, you will be fingerprinted when you leave and again\nbefore you reenter. During breaks, you are prohibited from accessing phones, electronic devices, and\nnotes, among other items stored in lockers. However, you are permitted to access food, drink, or medication\nduring breaks.\n• Smoking areas are not provided at the testing centers.\n• No questions concerning the examination’s content may be asked during the examination period. Please\nlisten carefully to instructions from testing-center staff and read all directions thoroughly.\n• BACB examinations are delivered via the Internet and, occasionally, Internet connectivity at Pearson VUE\ntesting centers may result in technical problems (e.g., slow screen-load times, screen freezes), which may\nrequire rebooting the computer. Answers and examination times (time allotted and time used) are not\naffected by these technical issues, even in the case of a computer restart.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

Note that the\ntime spent reviewing these Terms and Conditions is part of the examination time.\nThe Terms and Conditions are as follows:\n• Proctors will continuously monitor by video and audio while candidates are taking the examination. The\ncandidate recognizes that they have no right to privacy during examination delivery and that they waive\nany and all claims asserting a right to privacy. The candidate will also acknowledge and consent to audio\nand video recording of their face, voice, the physical room where they are seated, and the location during\nexamination delivery. If a candidate does not wish to be recorded (either by video or audio), they must notify\nthe proctor immediately of intent not to proceed with the examination.\n• No materials, documents, notes, or memoranda of any sort may leave an on-site testing center or be in the\nproximity of the remote examination area. CANDIDATES ARE PERMANENTLY PROHIBITED FROM EVER\nDISCLOSING THE CONTENT OF BACB EXAMINATION QUESTIONS. This prohibition includes verbal,\nwritten, and/or electronic (e.g., email, chat room, or other Internet or electronic) disclosure. The BACB\nexaminations are copyright protected and highly confidential trade secrets. Any disclosure or reconstruction\nof test questions and content shall be a violation of BACB rules and subject to damages including, but\nnot limited to, the cost of replacing the compromised question(s) and reconstruction of the examination, if\nadvisable, at the discretion of the BACB.\n• The proctors are authorized to maintain a secure and proper examination administration. Candidates\nmay not communicate with other examinees or third-party individuals during the examination. The BACB\nconsiders unauthorized sharing of examination content with others to be a violation of copyright laws and\nwill constitute cheating on the examination. Cheating or permitting cheating (such as letting someone\ncopy answers or providing information on the content of examination questions to others) will be cause for\nautomatic disqualification and dismissal from the examination. At the sole discretion of the BACB and/or the\nBACB’s testing vendor, irregular, disruptive, inappropriate, or suspected cheating behavior by the candidate\nmay result in any combination of the following:\n• relocation or removal from the examination site\n• immediate termination of examination delivery\n• a cancellation or an invalidation of examination scores\n• temporary inactive certification pending investigation of the irregularity\n• a requirement that candidates retest to confirm examination scores. In such event, the retest will be free\nof charge\n• a refusal to permit the candidate to retest\n• other disciplinary action related to the eligibility or certification status\n• a forfeiture of all application and examination fees paid by the candidate\n• The BACB may permanently restrict an authorization to sit for a BACB examination if a candidate is found by\nthe BACB to have cheated on the examination or compromised the content of the examination. The BACB\nreserves the right to report examination content theft to applicable law enforcement authorities, and the\ncandidate authorizes the BACB to release the candidate’s name, examination performance data, audio and\nvideo files from the examination administration, and other pertinent information necessary to demonstrate\nthe basis for finding that the candidate participated in or benefited from theft of BACB examination content.\n• ANY use of an electronic device while an examination is in progress is grounds for termination of the\nexamination and will result in the examination scores being withheld and/or invalidated. Any item visible\nduring an examination including, but not limited to, cell phones, electronic devices, bags, purses, briefcases,\njewelry, and items worn by the candidate may be investigated at the discretion of the examination proctor.\n• If the candidate does not follow the Terms and Conditions or is suspected of cheating or tampering with\nPearson VUE’s or its subcontractor’s software, the administered examination will be immediately terminated.\nThis will be reported to Pearson VUE and the BACB, along with audio and/or video evidence of the\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

Comments are not graded and do not affect individual\nscores, although they may be used during an examination review. The BACB will not provide feedback\nregarding any comments. Candidates will not be given extra time to make up for the time lost while\nproviding comments.\n• Candidates taking the examination at an on-site testing center only may use the restroom. The candidate will\nneed to raise their hand to inform the proctor. The proctor will secure the workstation while the candidate\ngoes to the restroom. Candidates will not be given extra time to make up for any lost examination time.\nCandidates CANNOT leave their seat at any time unless the proctor has secured the workstation and\nWILL NOT be permitted to access or use a cell phone or electronic device. If at any time the candidate\nleaves their computer or work area without the permission of the proctor, the candidate will be unable to\ncontinue testing.\n• All questions on this examination are equally weighted. There is no penalty for guessing; therefore; it is to\nthe candidate’s advantage to answer every question on the examination, even if they are not sure about the\ncorrect answer. No credit will be given for questions that are left blank. When answering questions, choose\nthe BEST answer to each question.\nExamination Security\nThe BACB and Pearson VUE take examination security seriously because the value of your certification and our\ncredibility depend on it. BCaBA certification examination content is confidential; it is never appropriate to share,\ndiscuss, post, or upload examination content. In addition, candidates are required to adhere to the Code, which\nincludes the following requirement: “Behavior analysts are truthful and honest and arrange the environment to\npromote truthful and honest behavior in others.”\nUnauthorized possession, reproduction, publication, or disclosure of any BACB examination materials—including\nstoring or disclosing examination questions to any person or entity by any means before, during, or after the\nexamination—is prohibited and can result in program disqualification or other appropriate censure. Examples of\nviolations and misconduct include:\n• submitting false, inconsistent, or misleading statements or omitting information the BACB requests\n• attempting to take the examination for someone else or having someone else take the examination for you\n• copying or sharing information or any other form of cheating\n• obtaining advanced access to examination materials\n• stealing examination materials\n• bringing prohibited items into the examination room\n• failing to follow directions from testing-center staff\n• violating Pearson VUE scheduling or testing-center rules and regulations\nPearson VUE Examination Fees\nPearson VUE will charge a fee of $125 for every new BCaBA examination appointment. This fee is in addition to\napplication fees paid to the BACB and is paid directly to Pearson VUE when you make your appointment. You may\nbe required to pay applicable sales tax, value-added tax, GST, or similar tax required by law in the country or locality\nin which you are testing. If taxes are applicable, Pearson VUE will collect them at the time of scheduling. Fees are\nnonrefundable and nontransferable.\nAny appointments canceled or rescheduled within 30 days of the examination date are subject to a fee.\nAppointments that are canceled or rescheduled 30 or more days before an examination appointment will not\nincur a fee.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

You will receive your\nBCaBA certificate in the mail within 4–6 weeks (so make sure that your mailing address is correct\nin your BACB account).\nBCaBA Certificate Sample\nWhen can I start using my BCaBA certification? You may start using your BCaBA certification\nas soon as you have passed the examination and have a qualified BCaBA supervisor on record\nwith the BACB. If at any point you do not have a BCaBA supervisor on record with the BACB\nwho is providing your ongoing supervision, you may not practice, and your certification will be\nconsidered inactive (see the Ongoing Supervision section for more information about ongoing\nYour supervisor can\nsupervision requirements).\nadd you to their\nrecord through their\nIn addition, please contact your state, regional, or national behavior-analytic professional\nBACB account.\nassociations to learn about any additional requirements for practice as an assistant behavior\nanalyst in your region and to access valuable support in the profession. If you reside in a US\nstate where assistant behavior analysts are licensed, you should immediately contact your\nstate licensure board to determine whether and how you should submit an application for\nlicensure before practicing with your new BACB certification.\nHow can employers and funders, among others, verify my certification? Newly certified BCaBAs appear in the\nCertificant Registry within 48 hours of passing the examination. The Certificant Registry shows the status of your\ncertification and recertification date, and if your certification becomes inactive for any reason (e.g., you do not have a\nsupervisor on record with the BACB), this will be indicated on the registry.\nAnyone may request a written verification of their current certification status from the BACB for a $25 fee per\nverification. The verification letter is delivered as an emailed PDF document or state-issued verification form and\ncontains the information shown on the registry.\nWhat does it mean now that I am certified? Becoming certified means you have demonstrated that you have the\nknowledge and skills of an entry-level assistant behavior analyst who practices under the oversight of a BCBA. That\nsaid, consider what you are proficient in, what you know a little about (but need more experience and mentorship\nin), and what you do not know to ensure that you do not overstate your expertise to the public. Consider your scope\nof competence (e.g., populations or behavior-analytic techniques you are capable of serving or using) because you\nhave an ethical obligation to refrain from practicing outside your scope of competence (see the Code).\nWhat steps should I take to begin my career as a professional?\nThe BACB cannot provide guidance on this outside of the requirements to maintain your\ncertification, so the first step might be to identify a supervisor and mentor who can help you\ndevelop a professional-development plan. That plan might include determining your scope of\ncompetence; recognizing skill sets that you need support with (e.g., billing) to move toward your\ngoals; identifying ways to stay in contact with the literature (as a certificant, you have free access\nto recent issues of major behavior-analytic journals in your BACB account); and identifying ways to\nstay or get involved with the professional community, such as joining professional associations. A\nsupervisor and mentor might also be able to help you determine how to assess job opportunities\nto make sure they fit within your scope of competence and career goals; whether you are ready\nand qualified to serve as a supervisor, assessor, or trainer (see the Assessing, Training, and\nSupervising RBTs section); and whether a service organization has an environment that is set up\nto promote ethical behavior.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "ExAmINATION\nHow should I maintain my certification moving forward?\n• Review the Certification Maintenance Requirements section and develop a plan to meet them, including\nreceiving ongoing supervision for the behavior-analytic services that you provide, accruing continuing\neducation, and complying with ethics requirements (e.g., ensure that you accept clients within the\nboundaries of your competence, have appropriate service contracts, provide appropriate services, follow\nprocedures to ensure continuity of care and appropriate client transitions).\n• Be sure to keep an eye out for helpful resources, like BACB videos, blogs, and podcasts. For example,\nthe Tips for New Certificants blog shares valuable information for newly certified individuals, and The\nProfessional Infrastructure of Applied Behavior Analysis video describes the various organizations in ABA.\n• Keep your contact information up to date in your BACB account to ensure that you receive important\nupdates about certification requirements, and periodically review bacb.com to stay informed of changes.\n• Report critical events to the BACB Ethics Department (see the Self-Reporting section of the Code).\n• Stay up to date with licensure requirements in your area.\nTips for Protecting Your BACB Information\nThe BACB works to ensure the security of our certificants’ information. Despite our efforts, however, you are\nstill at risk of someone misusing your credential, most commonly for billing fraud. Given the prevalence of\nopen electronic access and digital identity theft, here are a few ways that you can take a proactive approach to\nmaximizing the security of your professional credentials.\n• Check your BACB account regularly. Put a reminder in your calendar to log in and check the accuracy of\nthe information in your BACB account every six months or more frequently if you have been—or suspect\nyou may be—the target of identity theft. It is critical that you log in to ensure that your information is\naccurate and review how your information is publicly displayed in the Certificant Registry. In addition to\nyour personal information, review the information specific to supervisees or supervisors to make sure it is\ncorrect. If you find any inconsistencies or inaccuracies, use the Contact Us form to immediately inform us\nof the potential issue.\n• Protect your BACB certificate. While your certification number is publicly available in the Certificant\nRegistry, you should protect your BACB certificate from being copied and/or modified. Think twice before\nposting photos of your certificate on social media platforms, and be sure to keep your private BACB\naccount ID number protected. This number is not published in the Certificant Registry and is generally\nonly needed by your supervisees/trainees, the BACB, and certain funding sources.\n• If you suspect misuse of your information, contact a specialist (e.g., attorney/advisor) in identity theft\nto help you determine your options. While BACB staff cannot provide legal advice, we are sympathetic\nto the frustrations you may experience if your information is misused. Finally, if you suspect the misuse\nor misappropriation of another certificant’s credential (or the creation of false credentials), please\nimmediately report your evidence to the appropriate authorities (e.g., law enforcement, funders) and to\nthe BACB using the Reporting Infringement or Misuse Form.\nFor additional guidance, please refer to the August 2019 newsletter on our Newsletters web page.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

Any BCaBA who does not have a\nqualified supervisor will be considered inactive and may not practice or use their BCaBA certification until they have\na supervisor. The supervisor and the BCaBA must review these requirements together and resolve any concerns at\nthe onset of supervision. Both parties must also ensure that any supervision provided or received is consistent with\ncurrent BACB requirements (via regular review of BACB Newsletters and web pages for updates), any applicable\nstate regulatory standards (e.g., licensure), and relevant third-party payer requirements.\nSupervisor Requirements\nSupervisor Qualifications: Supervisors must be one of the following:\n• an active BCBA without current disciplinary sanctions who meets an ongoing supervision CEU requirement\nOR\n• a licensed or registered psychologist certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology in\nBehavioral and Cognitive Psychology who was tested in applied behavior analysis.\nSupervisor Training: Supervisors must complete an 8-hour supervision training before providing any supervision to\nthose accruing experience hours.\nSupervisors are responsible for ensuring that they have completed the training (available in the Certificant Registry)\nand uploaded the certificate into their BACB account before signing a supervision contract. Trainees should confirm\nthe date on which the supervisor completed the training before signing a supervision contract.\nPublic Identification of Supervisory Relationship: The supervisor must acknowledge the supervisory relationship\nby entering the supervisee’s information in their BACB account. The supervisor will also be publicly identified in\nthe BCaBA’s record in the Certificant Registry. Under the Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior\nAnalysts, the supervisor is responsible and can be held accountable for all services provided by the BCaBA.\nSupervisor/Trainee Relationship: The supervisor may not be related to, subordinate to, employed by, or in a\nmultiple relationship with (e.g., personal or business relationship) the supervisee while providing supervision.\nEmployment does not include compensation paid to the supervisor by the BCaBA for supervision services. While\nnot required, it is highly encouraged that the supervisor works closely with the BCaBA during the implementation of\nbehavior-analytic services.\nSupervision Requirements\nAmount of Supervision: The amount of supervision required for a BCaBA is based on the number of servicedelivery hours in a month and how long the BCaBA has been certified. The amount-of-supervision requirements are\nas follows:\n• First 1,000 hours of post-certification practice: Supervision must comprise at least 5% of the total number of\nbehavior-analytic service hours provided per month with no less than 1 hour of supervision every 2 weeks.\n• Ongoing supervision (after the first 1,000 hours): Supervision must comprise at least 2% of the total\nbehavior-analytic service hours provided per month.\nThese supervision percentages should be considered a minimum. Supervisors may require additional supervision.\nFrequency of Supervision: Each month in which the BCaBA provides behavior-analytic services, the BCaBA and\nsupervisor must meet at least once. In addition, the BCaBA’s supervisor must be available for consultation between\nsupervisory interactions. Note: BCaBAs who do not provide behavior-analytic services during a given month are\nexempt from this requirement.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

This section contains guidance on the possible\nstructural variations.\n• Group Supervision: Groups are interactive meetings in which 2–10 BCaBAs who share similar experiences\nparticipate in supervision activities (see the Nature of Supervision section). The number of BCaBAs in a\ngroup meeting may not exceed 10 at any time, regardless of the number of supervisors in the meeting.\nIf nonsupervisees are present, their participation should be limited, and their presence must not inhibit\ndiscussion or interfere with participation by supervisees. The amount of group supervision may not exceed\nthe amount of individual supervision in a given supervisory period. In other words, supervision may be\nconducted in groups for no more than half of the total supervised hours in each supervisory period.\n• Multiple Supervisors and/or Settings: A BCaBA may have multiple supervisors if such an arrangement is\nrequired to cover the BCaBA’s entire caseload. The BCaBA must ensure that a qualified supervisor assumes\nresponsibility for each case and provides supervision that meets the current supervision requirements. In\nthese arrangements, the supervision contract must clearly articulate the conditions of responsibility for each\nsupervisor, including the cases and settings in which the BCaBA will be observed.\n• Observation-With-Client Requirements: The BCaBA must be observed working with a client in the natural\nenvironment once per quarter by at least one supervisor. If the BCaBA has more than one supervisor, they\nmust be observed once per quarter by each supervisor. In-person, on-site observation is preferred. However,\nthe observation may be conducted using asynchronous (e.g., recorded video) or synchronous (e.g., live\nvideo conference) formats.\nNature of Supervision: The purpose of supervision is to improve and maintain the behavior-analytic, professional,\nand ethical repertoires of the BCaBA and facilitate the delivery of high-quality behavior-analytic services to the\nBCaBA’s clients. Effective behavior-analytic supervision includes:\n• monitoring the skills of the BCaBA as they deliver behavior-analytic services\n• developing and communicating performance expectations to the BCaBA\n• conducting behavioral-skills training for the BCaBA\n• observing the BCaBA’s performance with clients and delivering feedback\n• modeling technical, professional, and ethical behavior\n• guiding the development of behavioral case conceptualization and problem-solving and decisionmaking repertoires\n• reviewing the BCaBA’s written materials (e.g., behavior programs, data sheets, reports) and delivering related\nfeedback about the products\n• overseeing and evaluating the effects of the BCaBA’s behavior-analytic service delivery\n• evaluating the effects of supervision throughout the experience\nFailure to be Properly Supervised\nAny BCaBA found to be substantially noncompliant with supervision requirements will be subject to immediate\ntermination of their certification. If termination occurs, the BCaBA will be permitted to requalify for the examination via\npast certification. If requalified, the BCaBA will be subject to increased supervision requirements audits.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "CErTIFICATION mAINTENANCE rEqUIrEmENTS\nApplying for Reactivation\nIf you are on voluntary inactive status for less than four years and wish to reactivate your certification, you must\nsubmit a BCBA/BCaBA Request to Return from Voluntary Inactive Status Application.\nOnce your certification is reactivated, your recertification cycle will resume. If your certification remains inactive for\na period of four years, you must request reactivation, or your certification will expire. Once you have returned from\ninactive status, you may not apply for inactive status again until your next recertification cycle\nExample of how your recertification cycle is paused while on voluntary inactive status:\nIf you go on inactive status 12 months into your recertification cycle, you will have needed to\ncomplete 10 CEUs. When you return, you will need to accrue the remaining CEUs for the next 12\nmonths of your cycle before your next recertification date. Your next recertification date will be 12\nmonths from the date that you return from inactive status.\nActive Duty/Reserve Status\nIf you are called to active military duty in the armed forces and are actively certified, you may apply for a temporary\npause of your recertification cycle or examination authorization period to cover the time frame for which you are\ncalled (not to exceed two years). While on reserve inactive status, you are prohibited from representing yourself as a\nBCaBA. This policy only applies to service members. If a spouse of a service member wishes to go on inactive status,\nthey must apply for voluntary inactive status.\nUpon being called to active duty, notify the BACB via the Contact Us web page and provide a copy of your official\ncall-up notice. The BACB will place your certification on inactive status during your active duty period. Following\ncompletion of your active duty or two years, whichever is earlier, you must contact the BACB to update your\ncertification status. When your certification becomes active again, your recertification cycle or authorization period\nwill resume.\nFees*\nInactive Status Fees\nBCaBA Application for Voluntary Inactive Status $50\nBCBA/BCaBA Request to Return from Voluntary Inactive Status Application\n$0\n(0–2 years inactive)\nBCBA/BCaBA Request to Return from Voluntary Inactive Status Application\n$50\n(2–4 years inactive)\nActive Duty/Reserve Status $0\n* BACB fees are nonrefundable.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

Supervisors\nare often best positioned to immediately and directly address some ethics violations by an RBT. Therefore, in an\ninstance where an RBT Supervisor becomes aware of a potential ethics violation by an RBT, they must take steps\nto investigate and document the alleged violation. If they determine that a violation did occur, they should decide\nif the matter should be addressed internally or by submitting a Notice of Alleged Violation to the BACB.\nSubmit a Notice of Alleged Violation against the RBT if the alleged violation:\n• involves abuse or neglect of a client;\n• resulted in the RBT being charged with or convicted of a violation of the law;\n• is a violation of 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 3.01, or the preamble obligations to the BACB outlined in the RBT Ethics Code; OR\n• has occurred repeatedly despite reasonable attempts to address the problem with the RBT.\nIf none of these situations apply, the RBT Requirements Coordinator and/or RBT Supervisor should develop and\nimplement an individualized corrective-action plan for the RBT and document the outcome. The BACB reserves\nthe right to audit the RBT Requirements Coordinator or RBT Supervisor for documentation of the complaint,\ninvestigation, and resolution.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "ASSESSINg, TrAININg, AND SUPErvISINg rBTS\nTips for Supervising RBTs\nBeing a supervisor is an important responsibility in both shaping future behavior analysts and helping to facilitate\nquality services being provided to clients. With that in mind, here are a few tips for those who supervise.\n• Know the RBT supervision requirements. This might be obvious by now, but supervisors should know\nthe relevant requirements for supervision and stay up to date about requirements changes by reading\nthe BACB Newsletter and periodically reviewing the BACB website and BCaBA and RBT Handbooks.\n• Become intimately familiar with the BACB’s ethics Codes. Supervisors should know the Code and the\nRBT Ethics Code. Not only do you need to follow the Code in your practice and supervision, but you will\nalso need to be an ethical resource and guide for your supervisees. In particular, the Behavior Analysts\nas Supervisors and Compliance with BACB Supervision and Coursework Standards sections of the Code\nare some of the most frequent ethics violations reported to the BACB (see the November 2019 BACB\nNewsletter for the most recent ethics data). So, it is important to review these sections carefully and take\nthem into account when determining how you will provide supervision. For instance, when determining\nhow many supervisees you can supervise, consider the number of clients on your caseload, how many\nhours each supervisee is working, and how much of your time will be dedicated to their supervision,\nthe clients’ needs, and the program settings, among others. Of note, abruptly discontinuing supervision\ncan negatively impact services, so make sure that you have transition plans in place when discontinuing\nsupervision services.\n• Consider whether you are ready to be a supervisor. We highly recommend waiting until after you have\nample experiences of your own before you supervise others. In addition, consider whether supervision\nactivities will be within your area of defined competence and whether you have the time and ability to\nsupervise RBTs.\n• Develop your time management and organizational systems. Have these systems in place before you\nstart supervision to ensure that you are meeting all relevant requirements. For example, you will need\na system for keeping your RBT supervisee accounts up to date with the BACB, documenting feedback,\nand evaluating the effects of your supervision, among other areas. In the event of an audit, it is your\nresponsibility to produce the requested documentation.\n• Evaluate fit before agreeing to supervise. Identify your work and supervision style before taking\non a supervisee to determine whether their style is a good fit. Both you and the supervisee have a\nhistory of experiences coming into the relationship, so it is helpful to know a little about them before\nagreeing to be their supervisor. If your styles don’t fit, determine whether you are open to adjusting your\nsupervision style.\n• Set clear expectations. Although a supervision contract is not required for supervising RBTs, setting clear\nexpectations at the beginning of supervision is valuable in all supervisory relationships.\n• Aim to provide high-quality, individualized, and effective supervision. Don’t just focus on doing enough\nto meet the BACB’s requirements. These were established as minimum requirements that allow flexibility\nfor variations in each setting. Think about what your past supervisors have done well (and maybe not so\nwell) so that you can identify how you can provide high-quality supervision. For instance, you may want\nto develop a supervision curriculum for the supervisee that includes behavior-analytic topics, specific\nskills that are important in practice (e.g., problem solving, interpersonal skills), and skills that they will\nneed when they become a supervisor (see the Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline [2.0]).\n• Continue your professional development as a supervisor and seek out a trusted mentor. These\ntips are only a starting point. There is growing literature on supervision, as well as continuing\neducation events and resources on the topic, so make continued growth and learning part of your\nregular schedule.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

Do not submit an appeal in order to\nrequest information about a denied application; you will receive detailed information (i.e., reasons for the denial,\nsteps that need to be taken to correct any deficiencies) at the time of the denial.\nHow to appeal: You must file a written request for appeal within 30 days of the date of the decision being appealed\nby completing the Administrative Appeal Request Form.\nExamination Appeals\nIf you experience examination condition irregularities (e.g., poor lighting, disruptive noises, long screen-load times)\nduring your examination, you may file an appeal with the BACB. Note: Pearson VUE sites deliver BACB examinations\nvia a web browser, so minor Internet bandwidth variances are to be expected. Examination scores, content,\nquestions, answers, procedures, deadlines, fees, and requirements may not be appealed.\nHow to appeal: You must file a written request for appeal within seven days of your examination appointment by\ncompleting the Administrative Appeal Request Form.\nAcceptable Signatures Policy\nThe BACB accepts electronic signatures* for applications and forms, whether submitted electronically or by\nmail. Although it is preferred that documents are digitally signed using a third-party electronic signature service\n(e.g., Adobe Sign, DocuSign, HelloSign), the BACB will accept any type of electronic signature (e.g., Adobe Fill &\nSign, JPEG of a signature), provided the document is signed by the appropriate party with the intent of signing\nthe document.\nThe BACB also accepts handwritten signatures on scanned documents, unless the document states that an\noriginal signed copy is needed. Alterations on documents (e.g., white-outs, strike-throughs) must be initialed by all\nrelevant parties.\n* An electronic signature is “an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other\nrecord and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record” (15 U.S.C. § 7006 (2000)). Simply stated, an\nelectronic signature is an electronic expression indicating a signee’s intent to sign a document. By contrast, a digital signature\nis a specific kind of electronic signature, which requires authentication of a signee’s identity.\nDocumentation Policy\nAll documentation submitted to the BACB, for any reason, becomes the property of the organization. Documents\nsubmitted to the BACB will be retained and/or safely discarded at the discretion of the BACB. For this reason,\ncandidates should retain a copy of their certification application and all supporting documentation.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

In this situation:\n• the supervision contract should clearly outline the roles, responsibilities, and expectations for the trainee and\nsupervisor (see the Supervision Contract section);\n• all supervision must be related to specific client programming;\n• the supervisor must have written permission to receive client information and must be well aware of the\norganization’s values, practices, and personnel; AND\n• the person signing the M-EVFs and F-EVF for Individual Supervisors must be able to agree to all of the\nrelevant attestations, including that all experience requirements were met.\nMultiple Supervisors at One Organization: An organization may coordinate and oversee multiple supervisors who\nprovide experience to a trainee. For example, a service organization might have multiple supervisors providing\nsupervision, or a university might coordinate all on- and off-campus activities under one system. The supervisors\nmust work together to ensure that all of their trainees’ experience requirements are met (e.g., all of the hours\nprovided by the supervisors are used to calculate the supervision percentage). One supervisor must ensure that the\nactivity is well organized and coordinated. In this situation:\n• the supervision contract should clearly outline the roles, responsibilities, and expectations for the trainee and\neach supervisor (see the Supervision Contract section);\n• all supervision must be related to specific client programming;\n• the supervisor(s) must have written permission to receive client information and must be well aware of the\norganization’s values, practices, and personnel; AND\n• the person signing the M-EVFs and F-EVF for Multiple Supervisors at One Organization (i.e., the responsible\nsupervisor) must be able to agree to all of the relevant attestations, including that all experience\nrequirements were met.\nNonverified Coursework: If you completed coursework in anything other than an ABAI Verified Course\nSequence, that coursework is considered nonverified. You must have your department chair complete a\nNonverified Course Content Attestation and submit it with your BCaBA Certification Application or your preliminary\ncoursework evaluation.\nObservation With a Client: The trainee/supervisee must be observed working with a client in the natural\nenvironment during each supervisory period by at least one supervisor. In-person, on-site observation is preferred.\nHowever, the observation may be conducted using asynchronous (e.g., recorded video) or synchronous (e.g.,\nlive video conference) formats. See the Experience Requirements and Ongoing Supervision sections for\nadditional details.\nOfficial Transcripts: Transcripts that are either:\n• electronically sent directly by the institution to the BACB\n• mailed in the original sealed and unopened envelope\nOngoing Supervision: Supervision of the services provided by an RBT or BCaBA as one of their requirements to\nmaintain their certification.\nPreliminary Coursework Evaluation: A preliminary review of coursework (i.e., a review that occurs before the\nsubmission of a certification application) by the BACB to determine whether it meets the coursework requirements.\nPreliminary Degree-Equivalency Evaluation: This evaluation will determine whether a degree obtained outside\nof the United States was from a qualifying institution and meets the current BCaBA degree requirement. You may\nrequest this determination as needed before completing a BCaBA Certification Application.\nProfessional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts: The document that describes ethics obligations\nfor BCBAs, BCaBAs, applicants, and trainees. All BCBAs, BCaBAs, applicants, and trainees agree to abide by\nthis Code.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

After this grace period, you\nwill lose your certification and will need to reapply and meet the eligibility requirements applicable at that time.\nResponsible Supervisor: A supervisor who signs an Experience Verification Form on behalf of an organization where\nmultiple supervisors are providing supervision for one trainee accruing experience hours and who meets supervisor\nrequirements for the entirety of the experience/fieldwork.\nRestricted Activities: The delivery of therapeutic or instructional procedures to a client for those accruing experience\nhours. Note: Not all time spent working with a client is considered restricted. For example, a number of unrestricted\nactivities may involve the trainee working directly with a client (see Unrestricted Activities).\nSupervised Hours: Hours accrued when a supervisor is present. These may include restricted or unrestricted\nactivities observed by a supervisor or individual or group meetings with the supervisor.\nSupervisee: For the purpose of BACB requirements, this includes RBTs and BCaBAs who are receiving supervision\nfrom a qualified supervisor (see Trainee).\nSupervisor: A supervisor might supervise trainees who are pursuing BCaBA certification (i.e., experience) or RBTs\nwho require ongoing supervision. BCaBAs who are serving as a supervisor must complete an 8-hour supervision\ntraining before providing any supervision and may not be related to, subordinate to, or employed by the trainee\nduring the supervisory period.\nSupervisor-Trainee Contact: A real-time interaction between the supervisor and trainee that takes place in an\nindividual or group format.\nTrainee: Any individual accruing experience toward fulfilling eligibility requirements for BCBA or BCaBA certification.\nUnrestricted Activities: Activities under the experience requirements that are most likely to be performed by a BCBA\nor BCaBA, including conducting assessments, staff training, and developing behavior plans, among others.\nVerified Course Sequence (Verified Coursework): ABAI works with institutions to identify and verify sequences of\ncourses—known as Verified Course Sequences—that meet the BACB’s coursework requirements. The ABAI Verified\nCourse Sequence Directory includes all Verified Course Sequences, Verified Course Sequence Coordinators,\ncontent hours, and dates for which the courses were verified. The BACB also publishes examination pass rates for\nVerified Course Sequences.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright© 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.
