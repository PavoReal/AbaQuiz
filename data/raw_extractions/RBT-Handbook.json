    "text": "OVERVIEW\nOverview\nAbout the Behavior Analyst Certification Board\nThe Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc.® (BACB®) has been the leader in behavior analyst certification\nfor over two decades. The BACB is a nonprofit corporation that was established in 1998 to meet professional\ncertification needs identified by behavior analysts, governments, and consumers of behavior-analytic\nservices. The BACB’s mission is to protect consumers of behavior-analytic services by systematically\nestablishing, promoting, and disseminating professional standards of practice.\nIn the profession of applied behavior analysis, the BACB’s primary role is to operate certification programs,\nwhich involves responsibilities similar to regulatory boards. In this role, the BACB establishes practice\nstandards, administers examinations, and provides ethics requirements and a disciplinary system for each of\nits certification programs. To learn more about our role and limitations, read our blog post, The BACB: What it\nis, What it Does, and Why, and listen to Episode 11 of our podcast, Inside the BACB.\nWhat Is a Registered Behavior Technician?\nThe Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) is a paraprofessional certified in behavior analysis. RBTs assist\nin delivering behavior-analytic services and practice under the direction and close supervision of an RBT\nSupervisor and/or an RBT Requirements Coordinator, who are responsible for all work RBTs perform.\nRBT certification was originally designed for settings in which a BCBA or BCaBA is already providing\nbehavior-analytic services. Thus, applying to become an RBT is most likely to occur after the applicant has\nbeen employed by the organization in which they will continue their work assisting qualified BCBAs and/or\nBCaBAs in their service-delivery activities.\nJurisdiction\nThe BACB currently accepts certification applications from individuals regardless of their country of\nresidence. Effective January 1, 2023, only individuals who reside in the US, Canada, Australia, and the United\nKingdom* may apply for BACB certification.\nAccreditation\nThe BCBA®, BCaBA®, and RBT® certification programs are accredited by the National\nCommission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the accreditation body of the Institute for\nCredentialing Excellence (ICE). NCCA’s Standards for the Accreditation of Certification\nPrograms were the first standards developed for professional certification programs to help\nensure the health, welfare, and safety of the public. NCCA standards articulate the essential\nelements of a high-quality certification program. Consistent with these standards, the\nBACB’s certification requirements, examination content, and procedures undergo regular\nreview by subject matter experts in the discipline. To learn more about accreditation, see\nICE’s video, Value of Accreditation: Why it Matters.\n* Individuals who reside in the UK may continue to apply for BACB certification through 2025. This date may be moved\nearlier if the UK Society for Behaviour Analysis seeks national recognition for UK behavior analysts, develops its own\ncredentialing system, and transitions current BACB certificants into the UK system.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright © 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "OVERVIEW\nWhy Should You Become an RBT?\nThere are many benefits to obtaining RBT certification, including:\n• It shows that you have met certain requirements that are critical in delivering behavior\nanalysis services.\n• It provides increased consumer protection since you must meet certain eligibility (e.g., pass a\nbackground check, meet certain knowledge requirements) and maintenance (e.g., receive ongoing\nsupervision, adhere to an ethics code) requirements to obtain and maintain certification.\n• It makes it easier for employers, funders, consumers, etc. to verify that you have certain knowledge,\nskills, and abilities; have appropriate oversight; and are not under disciplinary sanctions.\n• It is a widely recognized and respected credential since it is offered by the BACB, the nation’s first\norganization to certify behavior analysis professionals.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright © 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

This examination assesses your\nknowledge of the RBT Task List (2nd ed.) at a level consistent with that of an entry-level behavior technician.\nExamination Development\nThe RBT examination is based on the results of a formal job task analysis. These results serve as the\nfoundation of the examination content outline, also known as the task list. The RBT examination is currently\nbased on the 2nd edition of the RBT Task List.\nNote: The BACB follows nationally accepted standards for examination development that include the use of\nsubject matter experts and extensive surveys.\nPreparation\nThe BACB recommends that you prepare for the RBT examination by reviewing the RBT Task List (2nd ed.)\nand the materials gathered from your 40-hour training and Competency Assessment. The BACB cannot\nendorse specific study guides or other preparation materials, and the purchase of any study materials does\nnot guarantee that you will pass the examination.\nExamination Outline\nThe RBT examination comprises 85 multiple-choice questions, 10 of which are unscored pilot questions.\nEach question has 4 possible answers and only 1 correct answer.

If remote testing does not appear as an\noption at the time of scheduling, it is due to these restrictions, and in-person testing will still be available. The\nBACB reserves the right to require any candidate to test in person at an approved testing center for any reason.\nPearson VUE Examination Fees\nPearson VUE charges $45 for every RBT examination appointment. This fee is in addition to BACB\napplication fees, and Pearson VUE will collect it at the time of scheduling. You may be required to pay\napplicable sales tax, value-added tax, GST, or similar tax required by law in the country or locality in which\nyou are testing. If taxes are applicable, Pearson VUE will collect them at the time of scheduling.\nAny appointment canceled or rescheduled within 30 days of the examination date will be subject to a fee.

Accommodations requests must be submitted by a BACB Examination\nAccommodation Request Form. All accommodations requests must also be accompanied by appropriate\ndocumentation notating the reason for the accommodation(s). This documentation should identify your\ndisability and your need for the requested accommodations. Appropriate documentation may include\nan official letter, a report of test results, documentation of prior accommodations you have received\n(including any IEP plan you may have), and any other official documentation of your disability and your need\nfor accommodations.\nAll documentation should be compiled into a single PDF file and then submitted through the Submit Legal\nDocumentation form using the Accommodations Request or the Accommodations Questions categories.\nOnce the BACB receives your request and supporting documentation, it will conduct a review of the\nrequested accommodations.

    "text": "EXAMINATION\nThe BACB is dedicated to complying with all accommodation requirements, including the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990, as amended.\nWhile the BACB does not offer an official accommodations handbook or guide, the following\nresources provide examples of appropriate supporting documentation to include with requests for\nexamination accommodations:\n• ADA Revised Title III Regulations\n• Request Behavior Analytic Terms Translation for Examination Support\n• United States Medical Licensing Exam Guidelines for Test Accommodations\n• ADA National Network Guidelines\nWhat to Expect on Examination Day\nAt all Pearson VUE testing centers, the RBT examination is administered using a computer-based testing\n(CBT) format. For additional information, visit Pearson VUE’s BACB Certification Testing web page, which\noffers the following:\n• a tutorial to help you become familiar with the CBT format,\n• details about what to expect at a Pearson VUE testing center, and\n• testing center locations.\nPearson VUE’s online-proctoring platform, OnVUE, can administer the RBT examination in most locations, as\nlong as the room is secure, and you have a stable Internet connection. Before taking the RBT examination\nremotely, you must do the following:\n• run a system check (visit Pearson VUE’s Online Testing for Behavior Analyst Certification Board\n[BACB] web page for more information or to run a system check),\n• ensure that you are in a quiet, distraction-free area, and\n• have a valid ID.\nBe sure to verify that you can satisfy all computer, Internet-connection, and workspace requirements before\nscheduling an OnVUE examination. If you cannot meet these requirements for any reason, you should\nschedule an in-person examination at a Pearson VUE testing center.\nGeneral Rules for Taking the Examination at a Pearson VUE Testing Center\n• You are advised to arrive at the testing center approximately 30 minutes before your examination\nappointment to allow sufficient time for the check-in process. This process includes security\nmeasures, such as photographing, fingerprinting, and obtaining an electronic signature from each\ncandidate. Once an examination has been underway for 30 minutes, no candidates will be admitted\ninto the examination area.\n• You must provide TWO forms of valid identification to be admitted into the examination area.\nBoth pieces of identification must show your first and last name exactly as they appear in your\nBACB account. Any name discrepancy will prevent admission to the examination (e.g., providing a\nnickname on your BACB account, identification that shows a different last name due to marriage).\nPearson VUE does not make exceptions for name discrepancies based on marriage certificates.\n• Both pieces of identification must have your signature and be current (i.e., not expired). The\nprimary identification must be government issued and include both a photo and signature (e.g.,\na driver’s license or state/national ID). The secondary identification must include a signature\nbut need not include a photo (e.g., a signed credit card with a signature that matches the\ngovernment-issued identification).\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright © 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

The candidate will also acknowledge\nand consent to audio and video recording of their face, voice, the physical room where they are\nseated, and the location during examination delivery. If a candidate does not wish to be recorded\n(either by video or audio), they must notify the proctor immediately of intent not to proceed with\nthe examination.\n• No materials, documents, notes, or memoranda of any sort may leave an onsite testing center or be\nin the proximity of the remote examination area. CANDIDATES ARE PERMANENTLY PROHIBITED\nFROM EVER DISCLOSING THE CONTENT OF BACB EXAMINATION QUESTIONS. This prohibition\nincludes verbal, written, and/or electronic (e.g., email, chat room, or other internet or electronic)\ndisclosure. The BACB examinations are copyright protected and highly confidential trade secrets.\nAny disclosure or reconstruction of test questions and content shall be a violation of BACB rules and\nsubject to damages including, but not limited to, the cost of replacing the compromised question(s)\nand reconstruction of the examination, if advisable, at the discretion of the BACB.\n• The proctors are authorized to maintain a secure and proper examination administration. Candidates\nmay not communicate with other examinees or third-party individuals during the examination.\n• The BACB considers unauthorized sharing of examination content with others to be a violation\nof copyright laws and will be constituted as cheating on the examination. Cheating or permitting\ncheating (such as letting someone copy answers or providing information on the content of\nexamination questions to others), will be cause for automatic disqualification and dismissal from\nthe examination. In the sole discretion of the BACB and/or the BACB’s testing vendor, irregular,\ndisruptive, inappropriate or suspected cheating behavior by the candidate may result in any\ncombination of the following:\n• Relocation or removal from the examination site;\n• Immediate termination of examination delivery;\n• A cancelation or an invalidation of examination scores;\n• Temporary inactive certification pending investigation of the irregularity;\n• A requirement that candidates retest to confirm examination scores.

Any item\nvisible during an examination including, but not limited to: cell phones, electronic devices, bags,\npurses, briefcases, jewelry, and items worn by the candidate may be investigated at the discretion of\nthe examination proctor\n• If the candidate does not follow the terms and conditions, or is suspected of cheating or tampering\nwith Pearson VUE’s or its subcontractor’s software, the administered examination will be immediately\nterminated. This will be reported to Pearson VUE and the BACB, along with audio and/or video\nevidence of the infraction. The examination may be invalidated, and the BACB may take other\naction, such as precluding all future participation in testing and/or the certification program.\n• The proctor is not allowed to provide comments on any of the questions appearing on the\nexamination. If there is a problem with a question, such as a typo, the candidate may select the\n“comments” button and make a note concerning the problem. Comments are not graded and do not\naffect individual scores, although they may be used during an examination review. The BACB will not\nprovide feedback regarding any comments. Candidates will not be given extra time to make up for\nthe time lost while providing comments.\n• Candidates taking the examination at an onsite testing center only may use the restroom. The\ncandidate will need to raise their hand to inform the proctor. The proctor will secure the workstation\nwhile the candidate goes to the restroom.

No credit will be given for questions which are left blank. When\nanswering questions, choose the BEST answer to each question.\nExamination Security\nThe BACB and Pearson VUE take examination security seriously because the value of your certification and\nour credibility depend on it. RBT examination content is confidential; it is never appropriate to share, discuss,\npost, or upload examination content. In addition, candidates are required to adhere to the RBT Ethics Code,\nwhich includes the following requirement: “RBTs are truthful and honest and create an environment that\npromotes truthful and honest behavior in others.”\nUnauthorized possession, reproduction, publication, or disclosure of any BACB examination materials—\nincluding storing or disclosing examination questions to any person or entity by any means before, during, or\nafter the examination—is prohibited and can result in program disqualification or other appropriate censure.\nExamples of violations and misconduct include:\n• submitting false, inconsistent, or misleading statements or omitting information the BACB requests\n• attempting to take the examination for someone else or having someone else take the examination\nfor you\n• copying or sharing information or any other form of cheating\n• obtaining advanced access to examination materials\n• stealing examination materials\n• bringing prohibited items into the examination room\n• failing to follow directions from testing-center staff\n• violating Pearson VUE scheduling or testing-center rules and regulations\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright © 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "EXAMINATION\nExamination Appeals\nThe BACB is committed to reporting uncompromised and valid examination scores. Occasionally,\ncircumstances may invalidate examination scores. The BACB reserves the right to cancel or withhold\nexamination scores due to suspected or documented misconduct during testing at a Pearson VUE site or\nviolation of the RBT Ethics Code. The code requires certificants, candidates, and applicants to immediately\nreport any confirmed or suspected examination misconduct by others to the BACB.\nAdditionally, invalidation may also occur due to situations beyond your control—or that of the BACB’s—at the\ntesting site. If you experience examination condition irregularities (e.g., poor lighting, disruptive noises, long\nscreen-load times) during your examination, you may file an appeal with the BACB. Note: Pearson VUE sites\ndeliver BACB examinations via a web browser, so minor Internet bandwidth variances are to be expected.\nExamination scores, content, questions, answers, procedures, deadlines, fees, and requirements may not\nbe appealed.\nHow to appeal: You must file a written request for appeal within seven days of your examination\nappointment by completing the Administrative Appeal Request Form.\nExamination Results\nIf you test in person, you will be notified of your results at the testing site as soon as you complete the\nexamination. If you test remotely, you may view your results in your Pearson VUE account as soon as you\ncomplete the examination. In both instances, the BACB will confirm your results via email, and they will\nappear in your BACB account within approximately one week of completing the examination.\nExamination Retakes\nYou may retake the RBT examination for a maximum of 8 total attempts within a\n12-month period following your initial examination approval. An Examination Retake\nRBT applicants\nApplication will be available online via your BACB account within 48 hours of each failed\nare limited to 8\nexamination attempt. You will receive an examination authorization email within 48 hours\nexamination attempts\nof submitting the Examination Retake Application, which will provide further instructions\nwithin a one-year\non how to schedule a new examination appointment. A fee is not currently required to\nauthorization period.\nsubmit a retake application; however, you must wait 7 days to retake the examination\nfollowing your previous attempt.\nNote: If you do not pass the examination after 8 attempts and you still have time in your 12-month\nauthorization period, you must wait until your 12-month authorization period is over to reapply for\nRBT certification.\nScoring Methodology\nThe BACB uses the modified Angoff method for establishing the passing score for each base examination\nform. New base examination forms are created approximately every five years or whenever there is\na significant change to the examination content, such as the introduction of a new task list. The BACB\nmaintains a large pool of questions that can be used to generate many different forms of the examination\nthat are equated to the base examination.\nThe modified Angoff method is criterion referenced, meaning that the passing score for each base\nexamination is established by a panel of BACB-certified subject matter experts and then approved by the\nBACB Board of Directors. Your performance on the examination is not dependent on the performance of\nthose taking the examination with you.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright © 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

The RBT Ethics Code contains 31 elements that are organized into\nthree sections: Responsible Conduct, Responsibility to Clients, and Competence and\nService Delivery.\nWork directly with your supervisor(s) to ensure that you are complying with the RBT\nEthics Code. Consult your supervisor(s) if you have questions or concerns regarding\nBACB ethics requirements.\nRBT Ethics Code\nVisit the Ethics webpage for information about code enforcement\nprocedures, ethics resources, and more.\nSelf-reporting. In accordance with the current version of the RBT Ethics Code, applicants and certificants\nmust provide the BACB with information that could impact the BACB's ability to effectively communicate with\nthem or that might influence their status or certification.\nIn general, there are two types of information you should report to the BACB:\n1. changes in name, address, or email—Report these changes within 30 days of when the change occurred.\nThis may be done through your BACB account.\n2. other critical events or changes—Use the Consideration for Self-reporting\ndocument to determine if there is an event you need to report to the BACB’s Ethics\nDepartment. This might include one of the following events:\na. You are the subject of an ethics requirement violation, a disciplinary\ninvestigation, action or sanction, filing of charges, conviction or plea of\nguilty or no contest by a governmental agency, health care organization,\nthird-party payer or educational institution.\nb. You are named on any public health- and safety-related fines or tickets.\nc. You have a physical or mental condition that would impair your ability to\ncompetently practice.\nd. You have not been meeting maintenance requirements, such as Consideration for\nongoing supervision. Self-reporting\nIf you have an event to report, please complete the Ethics Self-Reporting form.\nFor more information about self-reporting, visit the BACB’s Ethics webpage.\nBehavior Technicians May Not be Independent Contractors in the U.S.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides definitions of two primary worker\nclassifications. A worker is an employee when the company controls what duties will be\nperformed and how they will be performed. A worker is an independent contractor when he/\nshe controls how the duties will be performed (e.g., which procedures are used). Behavior\ntechnicians – those who are certified (e.g., as an RBT) and those who are not – have\nincreasingly advertised their availability to provide services as independent contractors.\nBecause over 97% of RBTs reside in the U.S., we provide the following guidance.\nUpdated 09/2021, Copyright © 2021, BACB® | All rights reserved.

    "text": "CERTIFICATION MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS\nThe BACB defines an RBT as “a paraprofessional who practices under the close, ongoing\nsupervision of a BCBA, BCaBA, or FL-CBA.” Because an RBT is not an independent practitioner\nwith control over how his/her duties are performed, in the U.S. an RBT would almost never\nqualify as an independent contractor as defined by the IRS. Thus, any RBT who is working as an\nindependent contractor and any business that hires RBTs as independent contractors should\nimmediately consult a tax professional to confirm compliance with IRS regulations. The following\nresources might be helpful during this consultation:\n• The July 20, 2017 IRS Interpretation of Employee vs. Independent Contractor\n(See FS-2017-09, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2017).\n• The California Association for Behavior Analysis (May 2018) interpretation of this issue.\nIn addition to this being a serious IRS matter, failure to use the appropriate worker classification\nfor behavior technicians may constitute a violation of the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts.\nIn the event that a Code violation is alleged against you for mischaracterization of RBT services,\nthe BACB will request a copy of the written opinion of a tax professional to demonstrate that\nappropriate due diligence was exercised in making the classification.\nWe strongly encourage RBTs who are practicing outside the U.S. to consult with a tax\nprofessional in their country to determine compliance with applicable employment laws.\nAnnual Renewal\nYou must renew your RBT certification annually by your RBT expiration date. To renew\nyour certification, complete and submit an RBT Renewal Competency Assessment\nwith your renewal application.

Supervision\ndeviations that result in credential termination may only be appealed if the basis of the appeal is to correct\nmiscalculated hours. These policies and procedures shall apply to appeals by applicants or certificants.\nBACB standards, deadlines, procedures, and fees may not be appealed. Do not submit an appeal in order\nto request information about a denied application; you will receive detailed information (i.e., reasons for the\ndenial, steps that need to be taken to correct any deficiencies) at the time of the denial.\nHow to appeal: You must file a written request for appeal within 30 days of the date of the decision being\nappealed. To file an appeal, complete the Administrative Appeal Request form.\nExamination Appeals\nIf you experience examination condition irregularities (e.g., lighting, disruptive noises, long load times) during\nyour examination, you may file an appeal with the BACB. Please note, Pearson VUE sites deliver BACB\nexaminations via a web browser, so minor internet bandwidth variances are to be expected. Examination\nscores, content, questions, answers, procedures, deadlines, fees, and requirements may not be appealed.\nHow to appeal: You must file a written request for appeal within seven days of your examination\nappointment. To file an appeal, complete the Administrative Appeal Request form located on the BACB’s\nAdministrative Appeals webpage.\nAcceptable Signatures Policy\nThe BACB accepts electronic signatures* for applications and forms, whether submitted electronically or\nby mail. Although it is preferred that documents are digitally signed using a third-party electronic signature\nservice (e.g., Adobe Sign, DocuSign, HelloSign), the BACB will accept any type of electronic signature\n(e.g., Adobe Fill & Sign, JPEG of a signature) provided the document is signed by the appropriate party with\nthe intent of signing the document.\nThe BACB also accepts handwritten signatures on scanned documents, unless the document states that an\noriginal signed copy is needed. Alterations on handwritten documents (e.g., white-outs, strike-throughs) must\nbe initialed by all relevant parties.\n* An electronic signature is “an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a\ncontract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record” (15 U.S.C. § 7006\n[2000]). Simply stated, an electronic signature is an electronic expression indicating a signee’s intent to sign a\ndocument. By contrast, a digital signature is a specific kind of electronic signature, which requires authentication of a\nsignee’s identity.\nDocumentation Policy\nAll documentation submitted to the BACB, for any reason, becomes the property of the organization.\nDocuments submitted to the BACB will be retained and/or safely discarded at the discretion of\nthe BACB.
