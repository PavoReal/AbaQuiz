    "text": "SUPERVISOR TRAINING CURRICULUM OUTLINE (2.0)\nOverview\nThis curriculum outline is comprised of learning objectives, tasks, and considerations that are\nimportant for creating an effective supervisory relationship. Supervisors who oversee the work\nof (a) individuals acquiring fieldwork (i.e., experience1) for BCBA or BCaBA certification (trainees)\nand (b) current BCaBA or RBT certificants who are required to have ongoing supervision\n(supervisees) are required to complete an 8-hour supervision training based on this curriculum\nbefore providing any supervision. Supervisors, supervisees, and trainees should confirm the\ndate the supervisor completed the training prior to initiating the supervisor relationship.\nRequirements for Training Providers\nAll Authorized Continuing Education (ACE) Providers are eligible to offer supervision training\nbased on this curriculum outline. The cumulative duration of training must be at least 8 hours\n(but may be offered in units as brief as 1 hour). The training activities must include opportunities\nfor trainees to demonstrate verbal or practical competence of the curricular areas below.\nTraining may be conducted in person or online. The training may be completed up to 180 days\nprior to the learner’s2 original BACB certification date.\n2\nRequirements for Documentation\nACE Providers must provide the learner with a one-page document showing that\nthe learner completed the full training (see the ACE Handbook for documentation\nrequirements). The training provided must include a link to the BACB Supervisor Training\nCurriculum Outline (2.0), as well as the following text in all online and print materials for\ntheir training program:\n“This training program is based on the BACB Supervisor Training Curriculum\nOutline (2.0) but is offered independent of the BACB.”\nThe learner must upload the documentation described above into their BACB account.\nOnce the documentation has been approved and they meet all other relevant supervision\neligibility requirements, they may begin providing supervision.\n1 The term fieldwork will be used throughout this document to refer to the supervised practical\nexperience required for obtaining BCBA or BCaBA certification.\n2 We are using the term learner in this document to refer to those who are taking the supervision training.\nBehavior Analyst Certification Board | Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline (2.0) Version 01/2026, Copyright © 2022, BACB®",
