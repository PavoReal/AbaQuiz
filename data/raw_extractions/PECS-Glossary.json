Then, over subsequent trials, gradually increase the delay between presenting the cue and presenting the prompt so that the learner responds to the cue before the prompt is provided. |\n| Prompt | Any type of assistance or material modification “help” provided to teach a new skill. For independence to occur, prompts must be eliminated. Prompts may involve physical, spoken, gestural, visual, positional, etc. |\n| Prompting Strategies (also known as Teaching Strategies) | The use of a variety of strategies that comprise any “help” added to teach new skills and the systematic removal of this “help” as rapidly as possible so that the learner is responding only to the cue. |\n| Punisher | Consequences that lead to the weakening or decrease in a behavior in the future. |\n| Pyramid Approach to Education® (PAE) | Also known as ‘Functional ABA.’ A broad-spectrum applied behavior analytic model involving a systematic approach to designing effective learning environments based upon the science of behavior, with a strong emphasis on functional activities and functional communication skills.
