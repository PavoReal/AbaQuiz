---

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Significant Impact)

1. **Add Textbook Content**
   - Source: Cooper, Heron, & Heward "Applied Behavior Analysis" (3rd ed)
   - Focus on: Schedules of reinforcement, verbal operants, graphing
   - Impact: +10% coverage in Domains B, C, G

2. **Add Clinical Scenario Database**
   - Create fictional vignettes covering each domain
   - Essential for scenario-based questions (40% of generation target)

### Medium Priority

3. **Add Assessment Instrument Overviews**
   - VB-MAPP, ABLLS-R, PEAK, AFLS summaries
   - Impact: +15% coverage in Domain F

4. **Add Graph/Visual Examples**
   - Create markdown-compatible data display examples
   - Cumulative records, multiple baseline graphs

### Low Priority

5. **Remove Redundant Files**
   - `BCBA-Task-List-5th-Edition.md` is superseded by 6th Edition TCO
   - Consider archiving or annotating as legacy

6. **Standardize Document Headers**
   - Remove hash markers from visible content
   - Normalize metadata format

## Exam Alignment Summary

| Exam Weight | Domain | Coverage | Risk |
|-------------|--------|----------|------|
| 14% | B. Concepts & Principles | 85% | Medium |
| 14% | G. Behavior-Change Procedures | 80% | Medium |
| 13% | E. Ethics | 95% | Low |
| 13% | F. Behavior Assessment | 75% | **High** |
| 12% | C. Measurement | 80% | Medium |
| 11% | H. Interventions | 75% | **High** |
| 11% | I. Supervision | 90% | Low |
| 7% | D. Experimental Design | 85% | Low |
| 5% | A. Foundations | 90% | Low |

**Risk Assessment:** Domains F (Behavior Assessment) and H (Selecting Interventions) have the highest risk of insufficient question variety due to limited source content depth.

---

## Conclusion

The processed content library provides a **strong foundation** with official BACB documents accurately converted to markdown. The Ethics, Supervision, and Foundations domains have excellent coverage suitable for diverse question generation.

**Primary Concern:** The content skews heavily toward official policy documents rather than educational/explanatory materials. This may limit the depth and variety of:
- Application-based questions
- Definition/concept questions requiring nuanced examples
- Scenario-based clinical questions

**Final Grade: B+**

The content is accurate and well-structured but would benefit from supplementary educational materials to achieve comprehensive exam coverage.
