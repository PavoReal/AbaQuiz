## Overview

The BCBA Test Content Outline (6th ed.; TCO) describes the content that will appear on the BCBA® certification examination beginning in 2025. The TCO represents the knowledge and skills identified as being important for entry-level BCBA practitioners by the most recent job task analysis (see the February 2022 BACB Newsletter). The BCBA examination includes 175 scored questions and 10 unscored pilot questions. The TCO includes 104 tasks organized in 9 domains as follows:
