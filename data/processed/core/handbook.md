## Overview

### About the Behavior Analyst Certification Board

The Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc.® (BACB®) has been the leader in behavior analyst certification for over two decades. The BACB is a nonprofit corporation that was established in 1998 to meet professional certification needs identified by behavior analysts, governments, and consumers of behavior-analytic services. The BACB's mission is to protect consumers of behavior-analytic services by systematically establishing, promoting, and disseminating professional standards of practice.

In the profession of applied behavior analysis, the BACB's primary role is to operate certification programs, which involves responsibilities similar to regulatory boards. In this role, the BACB establishes practice standards, administers examinations, and provides ethics requirements and a disciplinary system for each of its certification programs. To learn more about our role and limitations, read our blog post, The BACB: What it is, What it Does, and Why, and listen to Episode 11 of our podcast, Inside the BACB.

#### Jurisdiction

The BACB currently accepts certification applications from individuals who reside in the following countries:

| Country | Upcoming Changes |
|---------|------------------|
| United States (US) | None |
| Canada | Ontario residents can no longer apply for RBT or BCaBA certification. Those holding RBT and BCaBA certification in Ontario have had their certification placed on voluntary inactive status. RBTs and BCaBAs who relocate to Ontario should contact the BACB to be placed on voluntary inactive status.<br><br>Ontario residents will no longer be able to apply for BCBA/BCBA-D certification as of June 30, 2026. Those holding BCBA/BCBA-D certification in Ontario will be able to maintain their certification. |
| Australia | Residents of Australia will no longer be able to apply for BACB certification as of January 1, 2027. Those holding BACB certifications in Australia will be able to maintain their certification. |

Existing certificants may maintain certification and reside in any country.

### What Is a Board Certified Behavior Analyst?

The Board Certified Behavior Analyst® (BCBA®) is a graduate-level certification in behavior analysis. Professionals certified at the BCBA level are independent practitioners who provide behavior-analytic services.

BCBA certificants may supervise the work of Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst® (BCaBA®) certificants, Registered Behavior Technician® (RBT®) certificants, and other professionals who implement behavior-analytic services. They may also function in the role of a BCaBA or RBT. Certificants may hold only one BACB certification at a time. When a certificant obtains a higher-level certification, their lower-level certification will expire after 180 days. If the lower-level certification expires during this 180-day period and the certificant wishes to renew or recertify while they are waiting for their new certification to be recognized by relevant stakeholders, they may submit a renewal or recertification application to maintain their lower-level certification throughout the 180-day period.

**Note:** In the interest of consumer protection and to ensure that the BACB certification mark is only used to accurately represent certification status, the BACB may seek legal and other remedies to address any misrepresentation of BACB certification (and/or any misuse of other BACB trademarks and logos) that constitutes trademark infringement. For more information about the use of BACB certification marks, see the September 2008, October 2013, and July 2021 BACB Newsletters.

#### Board Certified Behavior Analyst—Doctoral

BCBAs with doctoral training in behavior analysis may receive the designation of Board Certified Behavior Analyst-Doctoral® (BCBA-D®). The BCBA-D is not a separate certification, and it does not grant any privileges above or beyond BCBA certification. BCBA-Ds function in the same capacity as BCBAs (i.e., as independent practitioners who provide behavior-analytic services) and are required to meet all BCBA maintenance requirements.

### Overview of Becoming and Maintaining BCBA Certification

[DIAGRAM showing process:]
MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS → APPLY → TAKE & PASS BCBA EXAM → MAINTAIN

**MAINTAIN includes:**
- MEET CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS
- ADHERE TO ETHICS REQUIREMENTS
- RECERTIFY EVERY TWO YEARS

**ELIGIBILITY PATHWAYS:**
- PATHWAY 1: ABAI- OR APBA-ACCREDITED DEGREE
- PATHWAY 2: BEHAVIOR-ANALYTIC COURSEWORK
- PATHWAY 3: FACULTY TEACHING AND RESEARCH
- PATHWAY 4: POSTDOCTORAL EXPERIENCE

### Reasons for Becoming a BCBA

There are many benefits to obtaining BCBA certification, including:

- BCBA certification is the leading behavior analyst credential and is required by many funders and licensure boards. BCBA certification is offered by the first certifying entity in behavior analysis, the BACB, which has been certifying behavior analysts for over 20 years.
- BCBA certification shows that you have met certain requirements that are critical in providing and overseeing behavior-analytic services.
- BCBA certification provides increased consumer protection since you must meet certain eligibility and maintenance requirements to obtain and maintain certification.
- BCBA certification makes it easier for employers, funders, and consumers, among others, to verify that you have certain knowledge, skills, and abilities and are not under disciplinary sanctions.

### Accreditation

The BCBA, BCaBA, and RBT certification programs are accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the accreditation body of the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE). NCCA's Standards for the Accreditation of Certification Programs were the first standards developed for professional certification programs to help ensure the health, welfare, and safety of the public. NCCA standards articulate the essential elements of a high-quality certification program. Consistent with these standards, the BACB's certification requirements, examination content, and procedures undergo regular review by subject matter experts in the discipline. To learn more about accreditation, see ICE's video, Value of Accreditation: Why It Matters.

### You Want to Pursue Certification... Now What?*

So, you are interested in pursuing BCBA certification. What should you do now? Although the BACB cannot instruct you on how to meet our requirements, the content in this section is intended to provide some guidance that might be helpful as you start this journey.

#### A Few Tips Before Getting Started

First, carefully review both the eligibility and maintenance requirements that are detailed in this handbook. Second, determine which eligibility pathway you plan to pursue. The majority of BCBA certificants apply under pathway 1 or pathway 2, so this section focuses primarily on those pathways. Once you have selected a pathway, determine when you might apply, as it may take a few years to meet all of the requirements, and the eligibility requirements may change.

Third, you will want to create a BACB account using these tips:

- **Enter your full legal name** exactly as it appears on your government-issued identification. If it does not match exactly, you will not be able to take the examination. Name changes require review by BACB staff, so a name change could delay your ability to take the examination.
- **Use a personal email address** and not a work or school email address. Important notifications and reminders are sent to this address, so if you change employers or lose access to your school email address, you will not receive reminders, correspondence, or password resets.
- **Set up the profile yourself** and do not share your account information with anyone else, including your employer. This is your certification—no one else should be managing it for you. The contact information you provide must include your current address and phone number. It is very important that you list your current address, as your residence must be under the BACB's jurisdiction.
- **Update your information** in your BACB account as soon as changes occur (e.g., name change, address change, email address change).
- **Do not create more than one account.** If you are having trouble getting into your account, please use the Contact Us Form for assistance.

Creating a BACB account will give you a BACB ID, which you will need to add to documents as you work toward certification. Having a BACB account also means that you will receive important updates from the BACB.

#### Considerations When Exploring Training Options

You only receive your initial training once. If possible, don't pick your training out of convenience, expense, or geography. We recommend thoroughly researching the trainings before committing to one. While we can't provide guidance on where to receive your behavior-analytic coursework, here are some things to consider.

Ideally, you should obtain your education in behavior analysis from a behavior-analytic degree program. There are many benefits to this option. For instance, in most cases, you can meet all BCBA eligibility requirements in one place while also having engaging, non-classroom interactions with behavior-analytic faculty and students that will greatly enhance your education and begin to develop your behavior-analytic social networks. Even if you don't receive all of your supervised fieldwork through the degree-granting program, your faculty will likely help you identify where you can accrue your hours in an immersive behavior-analytic environment. If completing your education in a behavior-analytic degree program is a possibility for you, here are a few things to consider as you research programs.

First, research the faculty members and determine whether the program's interest(s) align with yours (see the ABA Subspecialty Resources on the About Behavior Analysis web page for some of the areas in which behavior analysis has been applied). Second, identify the program's structure to determine how much time you will have with your faculty and fellow students. Third, confirm that the program has a pathway to meet the BACB's coursework requirements.

*This is not a comprehensive resource for all activities you will need to or should complete as you prepare for certification.*

You may obtain your behavior-analytic coursework in one of the following ways:

- **APBA-Accredited or ABAI-Accredited or Recognized Behavior Analysis Degree Program (Pathway 1):** Master's degree (or higher) behavior analysis programs that have been accredited by APBA or accredited or recognized by ABAI (under ABAI Tiers 1, 2a, or 2b) have met quality standards for their curriculum, faculty, and supports, among others. If you receive a master's degree or higher from one of these programs, both the coursework and degree eligibility requirements will be met. Accredited or recognized programs may be found on the APBA and ABAI websites.

- **Behavior-Analytic Coursework (Pathway 2):** The other option is to complete behavior-analytic coursework at a university that offers coursework meeting the pathway 2 coursework and has a qualifying Pathway 2 Program Contact.

Finally, when determining where to obtain your coursework, you might also want to consider:

- **Program Focus:** Do you have any existing areas of interest? If so, does the program align with your professional goals? Is the program led by faculty with similar interests? Will the program help facilitate experience in areas that are meaningful to you?
- **Program Size:** Find out the size of each cohort and determine if the size is a good fit for you as a learner. This information can usually be found on the program's website. Our university pass rate documents also give an idea of program size by looking at the number of candidates who took the examination from an institution each year (see the Sort by Volume section of the document).
- **Program Structure:** Courses are usually taught on campus, online, or in a combination of online and on-campus experiences (again, this information should be available on the program's website). Consider what structure is the best fit for you as a learner. You might want to consider what has worked for you in the past. Were you successful in online courses? Did you need or value in-person experiences? In what setting did you learn the most and feel the most engaged?
- **Number of Faculty:** Determine how many part- and full-time faculty are on staff, especially in relation to the program size, to understand the student-to-faculty ratio.
- **University Pass Rates:** The BACB annually publishes examination pass rate data for universities with pathway 2 behavior-analytic coursework programs and ABAI-accredited programs. Passing the BCBA examination is not the most important part of your training, but, at a minimum, your training should prepare you to pass the examination.

Once you have identified where you will get your behavior-analytic coursework, your faculty mentor/advisor, program chair, and/or Pathway 2 Program Contact will be your resource(s) to help you meet the BACB's requirements along the way.

#### Considerations When Identifying Practical Fieldwork Opportunities

Hold on! Remember that qualifying behavior-analytic coursework needs to begin before fieldwork, so make sure you get your coursework situation figured out beforehand. Once you have started your coursework, determine where you want to accrue your structured fieldwork hours and whether it will give you the applied experience that will prepare you to practice independently after you are certified. For instance, consider the population(s) and setting(s) where you want to ultimately provide behavior-analytic services. The BACB cannot provide this guidance, so you should reach out to your Pathway 2 Program Contact, advisor, or employer for guidance about where to accrue fieldwork in your chosen area.

When identifying supervisor(s) to oversee your fieldwork hours, ensure that they are qualified to be your supervisor (see the Fieldwork Requirements section). In addition, you should focus on finding supervisors who have a successful track record of BACB supervision. You could do this in a number of ways, but here are a few ideas:

- Check on their certification status in the Certificant Registry to ensure that they are qualified to supervise and to see if they have any disciplinary sanctions.
- Look at how long they have been certified. We recommend identifying supervisors who have been certified for at least a year, if not longer. Note: BCBAs in their first year of certification who are supervising fieldwork must have a consulting supervisor.
- Gather information from the supervisor and past supervisees about the supervisor's style to make sure they are a good fit for you.
- Ask about their time and document-management systems. Caution: If you can't produce all of the necessary documents to support your fieldwork in the event of an audit, you might lose fieldwork hours, so you will want a very organized supervisor!
- Determine whether they are familiar with the BACB's requirements.
- Consider whether they could customize the fieldwork to your interests (while still meeting their ethical obligations as a BCBA to stay within their area of competence).

Once you have identified fieldwork site(s) and supervisor(s), complete the Fieldwork Checklist and Tip Sheet before you get started with each fieldwork site/supervisor. The BACB is not able to provide guidance beyond what is in our fieldwork requirements, as each situation is unique (e.g., whether a specific activity will qualify toward your fieldwork hours). Work together with your supervisor(s) to ensure that you are meeting the fieldwork requirements while also meeting your professional goals.

#### A Few Final Tips

- **Keep this handbook close by.** We will update the handbook quarterly as needed, so always make sure that you are reviewing the most current handbook to see what has changed since the last version. It is also important that you become familiar with all applicable licensure requirements in your area.
- **Frequently check the BACB website** for new resources, including videos, blogs, and podcasts. For example, the Tips for New Certificants blog shares valuable information for newly certified individuals, and The Professional Infrastructure of Applied Behavior Analysis video describes the various organizations within the ABA profession.
- **Get involved and engaged** with your behavior-analytic community! This might include joining or volunteering with your local, regional, or national professional associations and groups focused in your area(s) of interest. You will likely learn a lot and have an opportunity to contribute to behavior analysis and its consumers. Having professional support is helpful at every stage of your career, so create opportunities to identify trusted colleague(s), mentors, and/or groups now.
- **As you pursue certification, ensure that you do not represent yourself as a BCBA trainee or applicant** to prevent consumers from being confused about your qualifications. For more information about use of the BCBA certification mark, see the September 2008, October 2013, and July 2021 BACB Newsletters.

Review the following table for a general overview and the Supervised Fieldwork Requirements section to ensure you meet all the requirements.

##### Overview of Fieldwork Requirements

| | Supervised Fieldwork | Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork |
|---|---|---|
| **Fieldwork hours required to qualify** | 2,000 | 1,500 |
| **Supervisor qualifications** (see the Supervised Fieldwork Requirements section for additional supervisor requirements) | Supervisors must meet one of the following criteria:<br>• be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for at least one year, and meeting the ongoing supervision CEU requirement;<br>• be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for less than one year, and receiving monthly consultation from a qualified consulting supervisor. | |
| **Supervision hours per supervisory period** | 5% of hours | 10% of hours |

**Demonstrate that you meet this requirement when you apply** by submitting your signed Final Fieldwork Verification Form(s) (F-FVF). *Note:* If your fieldwork is audited, you may need to submit an audit log and other documents, such as your supervision contract, Monthly Fieldwork Verification Forms (M-FVFs), and/or documentation system, to support the information entered in your audit log. All current fieldwork requirements must be met.

### Pathway 4: Postdoctoral Experience 📅

To apply for BCBA certification via this pathway, you must have an acceptable doctoral degree from a qualifying institution that was conferred at least 10 years ago, have completed at least 10 years of postdoctoral practical experience, and have completed 500 hours of supervised fieldwork.

[DIAGRAM showing:]
DOCTORAL DEGREE (📅) + POSTDOCTORAL EXPERIENCE + SUPERVISED FIELDWORK = PASS EXAMINATION = CERTIFICATION

#### Doctoral Degree

You must have a doctoral degree from a qualifying institution. Any degree earned outside of BACB jurisdiction must undergo a degree equivalency evaluation to demonstrate that it is equivalent to a US doctoral degree. The BACB only accepts degrees that have undergone the degree equivalency evaluation process that it oversees at its expense. As of September 2021, the BACB no longer allows applicants to refute its determinations using another degree evaluation service.

**Demonstrate that you meet this requirement when you apply** by submitting an official transcript with a conferral date for your qualifying degree.

#### Postdoctoral Experience

The postdoctoral experience must:
- include 10 years of full-time, cumulative experience *practicing* behavior analysis (time spent teaching behavior analysis does not count) **AND**
- have occurred under a relevant state/provincial license or national professional credential. You may have held different credentials at different times during the 10 years.

**Demonstrate that you meet this requirement when you apply** by submitting a curriculum vitae showing this experience, signed attestations describing the behavior-analytic practice from current or former employers, and proof of the applicable professional credential(s).

#### Supervised Fieldwork

You must complete supervised fieldwork in applied behavior analysis. You may accrue your fieldwork hours under Supervised Fieldwork. This fieldwork must have started once you have completed 10 years of postdoctoral experience. The following table provides a general overview. You should thoroughly review the Supervised Fieldwork Requirements section to ensure that you meet all of the detailed requirements.

##### Overview of Fieldwork Requirements

| | Supervised Fieldwork |
|---|---|
| **Fieldwork hours required to qualify** | 500 |
| **Supervisor qualifications** (see the Supervised Fieldwork Requirements section for additional supervisor requirements) | Supervisors must meet one of the following criteria:<br>• be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for at least one year, and meeting the ongoing supervision CEU requirement;<br>• be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for less than one year, and receiving monthly consultation from a qualified consulting supervisor. |
| **Supervision hours per supervisory period** | 5% of hours |

**Demonstrate that you meet this requirement when you apply** by submitting your signed Final Fieldwork Verification Form(s) (F-FVF). *Note:* If your fieldwork is audited, you may need to submit an audit log and other documents, such as your supervision contract, Monthly Fieldwork Verification Forms (M-FVFs), and/or documentation system, to support the information entered in your audit log. All current fieldwork requirements must be met.

### Qualification for Examination via Past Certification

If your BCBA certification expired within the last five years, you may be able to requalify as a BCBA by sitting for and passing the BCBA certification examination. Qualification via past certification applications are only accepted from individuals residing in countries in which the BACB accepts new certification applications.

To be eligible for this option, you must also meet the following continuing education requirements:
- You obtained 16 continuing education units (CEUs) each year since the date your BCBA certification expired (prorated to the month you submit a Qualify for Examination via Past Certification Application).
- The CEUs you earned must meet the BACB's current CEU requirements and be entered into your BACB account before you submit your application. CEU documentation may include your previous certification number solely to connect it to a prior certification for this purpose.

If you become certified again via this option, you will receive a new certification number and recertification cycle. You must also adhere to the same requirements as a new certificant (e.g., 8-hour supervision training, consulting supervisor). Additional CEUs may be required if there is a delay in the application requirements (e.g., payment, documents received).

#### Applying via Past Certification

If you want to apply for BCBA certification via this option, you must complete the required CEUs, document them in your BACB account, submit a Qualify for Examination via Past Certification Application, and submit payment after your reinstatement period has ended. If your application is approved and you are authorized to sit for the BCBA examination, you must pass the current version of the examination within the two-year authorization period (see the Examination section for more details).

### Supervised Fieldwork Requirements

#### Introduction

One of the core eligibility requirements for those pursuing BCBA certification (trainees) is completion of supervised fieldwork in applied behavior analysis. This experience allows trainees to apply what they have learned in coursework to real-world settings under the ongoing guidance and supervision of a qualified BCBA supervisor. Supervised fieldwork not only strengthens technical skills but also helps trainees learn to collaborate and communicate effectively with consumers, supervisors, and families while maintaining high ethical and professional standards.

Individuals accruing their fieldwork hours must complete either 2,000 hours of **Supervised Fieldwork** or—when the more intensive supervision requirements are met—1,500 hours of **Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork**. Trainees will complete all of these hours under the supervision of a qualified supervisor, typically someone working at the organization or university where they are completing their coursework. Although trainees may accrue some of their fieldwork hours by directly implementing existing assessments and interventions with clients (i.e., restricted hours), at least 60% of the total hours must be spent conducting activities for their clients that more closely represent the tasks they will perform after earning BCBA certification. These hours are referred to as **unrestricted hours** and may include a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, conducting client observations and analyzing the data, developing programs for their clients, training staff and caregivers on behavior-analytic procedures, and meeting with clients to discuss behavior-analytic services.

While trainees complete their fieldwork hours, supervisors observe them working with clients and meet with them regularly throughout the month to support the development of their behavior-analytic, professional, and ethical repertoires, while also ensuring their clients receive high-quality services. Supervisors must provide fieldwork supervision and guidance in accordance with the requirements while adhering to the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts ("Code").

📄 **Although trainees may hold an RBT certification while completing their fieldwork hours, many of the tasks completed as part of RBT and RBT ongoing supervision requirements may not count toward fieldwork. See the 7 FAQs for RBTs Pursuing BCBA or BCaBA Certification blog post for more information.**

The following table provides a high-level overview of the requirements:

##### Overview of Fieldwork Requirements

| | Supervised Fieldwork | Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork |
|---|---|---|
| **Fieldwork hours required to qualify** | 2,000* | 1,500 |
| **Supervisory period** | 1 calendar month | |
| **Fieldwork hours per supervisory period** | Minimum of 20 hours–maximum of 130 hours | |
| **Number of contacts with supervisor per supervisory period** | 4 contacts | 6 contacts |
| **Observations with client per supervisory period** | 1 observation | 1 observation 📅 |
| **Supervision per supervisory period** | 5% of hours | 10% of hours 📅 |
| **Individual supervision hours per supervisory period** | At least 50% of supervised hours must be individual (i.e., group supervision may not exceed 50%). | |
| **Unrestricted activities** | At least 60% of overall supervised fieldwork must be spent engaged in unrestricted activities. | |

*Under pathway 4, only 500 hours of Supervised Fieldwork are required.*

The following sections—**Fieldwork Requirements**, **Supervision Requirements**, and **Documentation of Fieldwork**—describe the requirements for supervised fieldwork (hereafter referred to as "fieldwork") in detail. Applicants applying for BCBA certification must meet all requirements at the time they apply, regardless of when their hours were earned. If any of these requirements are not met, trainees may lose qualifying fieldwork hours, and a Notice of Alleged Violation (NAV) may be filed against the supervisor. As a result, trainees and supervisors need to stay up to date by reading the BACB Newsletter, Recent & Upcoming Changes to BACB Requirements, and by checking the Version History and Updates section at the end of the Handbook for any updates.

#### Fieldwork Requirements

Supervisors must ensure that trainees are engaged in meaningful, real-world activities during fieldwork before applying for certification. Trainees are strongly encouraged to receive supervision from a variety of supervisors and work across various settings throughout their fieldwork experience to broaden their skills.

This section summarizes fieldwork requirements, including when fieldwork may begin, the specific fieldwork hour requirements, and which activities may and may not count as fieldwork.

##### Starting Fieldwork

Trainees may not begin accumulating fieldwork hours until they have:
- secured a qualified supervisor (see Supervisor Qualifications section);
- developed and signed a supervision contract with each supervisor (see Supervision Contract section); **AND**
- if applying under pathway 1 or 2, started qualifying graduate-level behavior-analytic coursework. (They may begin accruing hours after attending the first class meeting. For fieldwork hours to count, a passing grade of "C" or higher in a graded course or "pass" in a pass/fail system must be earned in this initial behavior-analytic course.); **OR**
- if applying under pathway 4: completed 10 years of postdoctoral experience.

📄 **Trainees should complete the Fieldwork Checklist and Tip Sheet and share it with the supervisor at each fieldwork setting before starting fieldwork.**

##### Hour Requirements

Trainees must complete a specific number of fieldwork hours.

**Number of Hours by Fieldwork Type:** To meet the fieldwork requirement, trainees must complete either 2,000 Supervised Fieldwork hours, 1,500 Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork hours, or a combination of the two (see the Combining Fieldwork Types information highlighted in the box below for more details). These totals include both independent hours (supervisor not present) and supervised hours (supervisor present). Each fieldwork type has different monthly requirements, so trainees and supervisors should review the Supervision Structures section for more information. Hours can only be accrued under one fieldwork type per month, per supervision structure, and all requirements of that fieldwork type must be met for the hours to count toward the fieldwork requirement.

##### Combining Fieldwork Types to Determine Total Hours

If hours are mixed across fieldwork types, trainees can estimate how close they are to meeting the total fieldwork hour requirement by following these steps:

1. Sum the total hours accrued under the Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork type.
2. Multiply the sum of the Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork hours by 1.33.
3. Add the total hours accrued under Supervised Fieldwork.
4. Ensure the combined total is at least 2,000 hours before applying for certification.

*Note:*
- The 1.33 multiplier is only (a) applied to Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork hours and (b) used to reach the minimum combined total of mixed hours (i.e., Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork + Supervised Fieldwork).
- When documenting hours on the M-FVF, F-FVF, and in the certification application, trainees should record only the actual hours accrued, not the adjusted total with the multiplier.
- In the event of an audit, trainees must indicate in the Fieldwork Audit Log which hours have been adjusted to meet the requirements.

**Accrual of Fieldwork:** Trainees must accrue no fewer than 20 and no more than 130 hours of fieldwork per calendar month.

**Duration of Fieldwork:** Fieldwork must be completed within five continuous years (e.g., May 1, 2020, to April 30, 2025). *Note:* The five years are calculated by calendar month, not date-to-date.

**Multiple Settings and/or Supervisors:** Trainees may accrue hours in multiple settings to reach the total hour requirements; however, they must meet all relevant requirements for each organized fieldwork experience (i.e., for each Monthly Fieldwork Verification Form (M-FVF) and Final Fieldwork Verification Form (F-FVF)) for every month of accrual. For example, if a trainee is accruing some hours with an individual supervisor in one setting and some hours with multiple supervisors in another setting, the trainee must independently meet the requirements at each site.

##### Fieldwork Activities

The trainee's primary focus should be on acquiring the skills necessary to demonstrate competence in behavior-analytic practice and the skills necessary to interact effectively with consumers, supervisors, families, and others. The following sections describe appropriate clients for fieldwork as well as acceptable and unacceptable fieldwork activities (and examples) to ensure trainees receive experience and supervision in activities that prepare them to become BCBAs.

**Appropriate Clients:** Any person (or group of people) for whom behavior-analytic services are appropriate may be a client. The trainee and supervisor must have a formal relationship with the client who is receiving services as part of the fieldwork activities. This may occur in one of the following situations:
- The trainee and supervisor are working at the same organization where the client is receiving behavior-analytic services.
- The trainee and supervisor each have a service contract with a specific client.
- The trainee and supervisor have a contractual relationship with the organization where the client is receiving services.

However, the trainee may not be related to the client, be the client's primary caregiver, or be related to the client's primary caregiver.

**Acceptable Activities:** All fieldwork hours must be related to specific client programming. Trainees must work with, be observed by, and receive feedback from their supervisor for multiple clients over the course of their fieldwork hours. In addition, trainees are strongly encouraged to have multiple experiences (e.g., different settings, populations), work with multiple supervisors, and gain experience in each of these areas:

- conducting assessments related to the need for behavioral intervention (e.g., stimulus preference assessments, functional assessments, staff performance assessments) or for evaluating behavioral interventions;
- designing, implementing, and systematically monitoring skill-acquisition and behavior-reduction programs;
- writing behavior plans, progress summaries, clinical notes, transition summaries, and professional correspondence;
- overseeing the implementation of behavior-analytic programs by others;
- training others, designing behavioral systems, and managing performance;
- communicating and collaborating effectively with stakeholders and other professionals;
- engaging in other activities typically performed by behavior analysts that are directly related to behavior analysis, such as attending planning meetings for a behavior-analytic program or researching literature relevant to a current client's programming.

**Unacceptable Activities:** Only behavior-analytic activities that are specific to a client may be counted toward fieldwork requirements. Non-behavior-analytic activities, while valuable, may not be counted. Examples of activities that will not count as fieldwork include:

- attending professional conferences, workshops, or university courses;
- completing didactic-course assignments (e.g., homework assignments, readings) and quizzes;
- attending meetings with little or no behavior-analytic content;
- providing interventions that are not based in behavior analysis;
- performing non-behavior-analytic administrative activities;
- participating in non-behavior-analytic trainings related to service delivery (e.g., crisis management, CPR, billing systems);
- completing non-behavior-analytic assessments (e.g., diagnostic or intellectual assessments), paperwork, documentation, billing, or any other activities that are not directly related to behavior analysis;
- listening to podcasts;
- role-playing behavior-analytic procedures that are not client related.

❓ **Can the BACB tell me if an activity counts toward my fieldwork hours?**

Because every trainee's goals are unique—and we cannot possibly know or anticipate all of the situational variables, populations, and settings in which they may be working—we cannot provide guidance beyond our certification requirements. However, your supervisors should review these requirements closely to determine whether the activities are in line with all of the requirements and best support the clients' needs and trainees' goals.

##### Types of Fieldwork Activity

To ensure trainees obtain skills in the activities most representative of tasks performed by BCBAs, at least 60% of their total fieldwork hours must be accrued from times when trainees are engaged in "unrestricted activities." This 60% requirement does not need to be met each calendar month (i.e., the supervisory period), but must be satisfied across the total accumulated fieldwork hours.

**Unrestricted Activities:** Activities that are unrestricted are those that are most likely to be performed by a BCBA. Unrestricted activities must comprise at least 60% of the total fieldwork hours (e.g., at least 1,200 hours of unrestricted activities out of 2,000 hours of Supervised Fieldwork). Examples of unrestricted activities include:

- observation and data collection;
- training staff and caregivers on behavior-analytic programs or content;
- conducting assessments related to the need for behavioral intervention;
- meeting with clients about behavior-analytic programming and services;
- conducting behavior-analytic assessments (e.g., functional analyses, stimulus preference assessments);
- data graphing and analysis;
- researching the literature relevant to a current client's programming;
- writing and revising behavior-analytic programs.

**Restricted Activities:** There is a restriction on the overall number of hours trainees may spend delivering therapeutic and instructional procedures during fieldwork. This restriction is designed to ensure that trainees have sufficient time to acquire the other skills necessary for practice as a BCBA. Restricted activities may comprise no more than 40% of the total fieldwork hours. There is no minimum requirement for restricted hours. This restriction does not necessarily refer to all time spent working with clients. For example, data collection could be a restricted activity if a trainee collects data solely as part of a client's treatment program.

#### Supervision Requirements

Because fieldwork supervisors shape the behavior of future behavior analysts and are essential in ensuring that the trainees' clients receive high-quality services, they play a vital role in fieldwork supervision. This section describes who may provide fieldwork supervision and the requirements they must follow.

##### Supervisor Qualifications

Supervisors must meet one of the following criteria:
- be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for at least one year, and meeting the ongoing supervision CEU requirement; **OR**
- be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for less than one year, meeting the ongoing supervision CEU requirement, and receiving monthly consultation from a qualified consulting supervisor.

All supervisors must also:
- complete an 8-hour supervision training (trainees may confirm their supervisor has completed this training by looking up their supervisor in the BACB Certificant Registry) and upload the certificate to their BACB account before signing a supervision contract. Trainees should confirm the date on which the supervisor completed the training before signing a supervision contract.
- ensure that they are not related to, subordinate to, employed by, or in a multiple relationship (e.g., personal or business relationship) with the trainee during the fieldwork period. Employment does not include compensation paid to the supervisor by the trainee for supervision services.
- abide by the Code, including the Responsibilities to Supervisee and Trainees section. *Note:* An NAV may be submitted against a supervisor for not providing supervision in accordance with these requirements.

📝 **Note:** *A supervisor may have been either (a) a licensed, registered psychologist certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology, or (b) a non-certified Verified Course Sequence Instructor prior to January 1, 2026. Fieldwork hours accrued under these supervisors may be used toward fieldwork requirements until December 31, 2031.*

##### Supervision Structures

A supervisor may either provide all of the supervision to a trainee each month (Individual Supervision) **or** collaborate with other supervisors at their organization to meet the fieldwork requirements for a trainee (Multiple Supervisors at One Organization). The following section describes the requirements for each structure.

**Individual Supervisors:** An individual supervisor must ensure that all of their trainees' fieldwork requirements are being met during their supervision. In this situation:
- the supervision contract must clearly outline the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of both the trainee and the supervisor (see the Supervision Contract section);
- all supervision must be related to specific client programming;
- the supervisor must have written permission to receive client information and must be well informed about the organization's values, practices, and personnel; **AND**
- the person signing the M-FVFs and F-FVFs for Individual Supervisors must be able to agree to all of the relevant attestations, including that all fieldwork requirements were met.

**Multiple Supervisors at One Organization:** When multiple supervisors work within the same organization, they may coordinate to oversee a trainee's fieldwork. For example, a service organization may have multiple supervisors providing supervision, or a university may coordinate all on- and off-campus activities under one system. The supervisors must work together to ensure that all of their trainees' fieldwork requirements are met (e.g., all hours provided by the supervisors are used to calculate the supervision percentage). One supervisor must ensure that the activity is well organized and coordinated. In this situation:
- the supervision contract must list all supervisors and clearly outline the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of each supervisor and the trainee (see the Supervision Contract section);
- all supervisors must sign the contract;
- all supervision must be related to specific client programming;
- the supervisor(s) must have written permission to receive client information and must be well informed about the organization's values, practices, and personnel; **AND**
- the person signing the M-FVFs and F-FVFs for Multiple Supervisors at One Organization (i.e., the responsible supervisor) must be able to agree to all relevant attestations, including that all fieldwork requirements were met. *Note:* The Responsible Supervisor must meet all supervision requirements for the entire duration of the M-FVF or F-FVF they sign.

##### Supervisor Responsibilities

When behavior analysts are functioning as supervisors, they must take full responsibility for all facets of the supervisory experience. Therefore, it is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure that the trainee abides by all ethical and legal requirements. Responsibilities of the supervisor include:

- being proficient in and compliant with all BACB requirements relating to fieldwork;
- confirming that the trainee has met all requirements before the outset of supervised fieldwork;
- consistently demonstrating technical, professional, and ethical behavior for the trainee;
- ensuring that fieldwork activities are in the best interest of the client rather than solely for the purpose of meeting the fieldwork requirements;
- providing supervision only within their areas of defined competence;
- taking on a volume of supervisory activity that is commensurate with their ability to be effective;
- delegating to their trainees only those responsibilities that trainees can reasonably be expected to perform competently, ethically, and safely—or providing the conditions for trainees to acquire those skills in an ethical and safe manner;
- ensuring that supervision, fieldwork activities, and trainings are behavior-analytic in content, are effectively and ethically designed, and meet the requirements for licensure, certification, or other defined goals;
- providing a clear written description of the purpose, requirements, evaluation criteria, conditions, and terms of supervision before the onset of supervision (i.e., behavior analysts are responsible for developing and executing the supervision contract). See the Supervision Contract section;
- designing and implementing feedback and reinforcement systems in a way that improves trainee performance;
- providing documented, timely feedback regarding the trainee's performance on an ongoing basis; **AND**
- designing systems for obtaining ongoing evaluation of their own supervision activities.

##### Amount of Supervision

Based on the type of fieldwork hours accrued, the trainee must have 5% (Supervised Fieldwork) or 10% (Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork) of their hours supervised by a qualified supervisor each calendar month. The supervision percentage is calculated by dividing supervised hours by total fieldwork hours (i.e., independent and supervised hours).

##### Nature of Supervision

The purpose of supervision is to improve and maintain the behavior-analytic, professional, and ethical repertoires of the trainee and to facilitate the delivery of high-quality services to the trainee's clients. Effective behavior-analytic supervision includes:

- monitoring the skills of the trainee throughout the supervised fieldwork;
- developing and communicating performance expectations to the trainee;
- conducting behavioral skills training for the trainee;
- observing the trainee's performance with clients and delivering feedback;
- modeling technical, professional, and ethical behavior;
- guiding the development of behavioral case conceptualization, problem-solving, and decision-making repertoires;
- reviewing the trainee's written materials (e.g., behavior programs, data sheets, reports) and delivering related feedback on these products;
- overseeing and evaluating the effects of the trainee's behavior-analytic service delivery; **AND**
- evaluating the effects of supervision throughout supervised fieldwork.

##### Structure of Supervision Interactions

The supervisor must meet with the trainee throughout the supervisory period (i.e., the calendar month) to provide frequent feedback and close oversight of their activities. Supervision may occur in individual or group meetings; however, at least half of the meeting time must be in individual meetings. Additionally, the supervisor must observe the trainee with the client(s) they are serving during each supervisory period. The following section describes these supervision requirements in more detail.

**Supervisor-Trainee Contact:** A real-time interaction between the supervisor and trainee that takes place in an individual or group format. There must be at least four supervisor-trainee contacts each supervisory period for supervised fieldwork and six contacts per supervisory period for concentrated supervised fieldwork.

**Individual Supervision:** Individual supervision occurs in one-on-one meetings between a supervisor and trainee. At least 50% of the supervision meeting time must be individual supervision each supervisory period.

**Group Supervision:** Group supervision is an interactive meeting in which 2 to 10 trainees who share similar experiences participate in the supervision activities described earlier (see the Nature of Supervision section). The number of trainees in a group meeting may not exceed 10 at any time, regardless of the number of supervisors present. If non-trainees are present, their participation should be limited, and their presence must not inhibit discussion or interfere with trainee participation. Unless the trainee is receiving supervision at an organization with multiple supervisors, group supervision must be provided by the same supervisor who provides individual supervision. Group supervision hours may not exceed half of the total supervised hours in each supervisory period.

**Observation of the Trainee with a Client:** At least one supervisor must observe the trainee working with a client in the natural environment during each supervisory period. In-person, on-site observation is preferred; however, the observation may be conducted using asynchronous (e.g., recorded video) or synchronous (e.g., live video conference) formats.

*Note:* The time a supervisor spends observing a trainee may also count as a supervision contact and as fieldwork hours if feedback is provided and the interaction occurs in real time. For example, if your supervisor watches an hour-long video of you delivering services but does not provide immediate, real-time feedback, that hour may count toward the observation-with-a-client requirement, but not the supervisor-trainee contact or total supervised hours requirement. However, if you and your supervisor watch the video together, pausing to discuss feedback and behavior-analytic principles, the hour could count toward all requirements at once.

#### Documentation of Fieldwork

To show that fieldwork requirements have been fulfilled, specific documentation requirements must be met. Only the F-FVF will need to be submitted as part of the BCBA certification application; however, the trainee must be prepared to submit all of the information described below in the event that their fieldwork is audited by the BACB. The following sections describe the documentation requirements.

##### Supervision Contract

Before supervision may begin, the trainee and supervisor(s) must develop and sign a written contract at the outset of the supervisory relationship. The purpose of the contract is to protect all involved parties and align fieldwork activities with the purpose of supervision. The contract should include:

- the responsibilities of the supervisor(s) and trainee, including the completion of the 8-hour supervision training by the supervisor(s) and adherence by all parties to the fieldwork requirements
- if there are multiple supervisors at one organization, a single contract may be used, but it must outline each supervisor's roles, responsibilities, and expectations, including how documentation and forms will be completed. All parties are required to sign the supervision contract.
- a description of the appropriate activities and training objectives individualized to the trainee
- the objective and measurable circumstances under which the supervisor(s) will not sign the trainee's M-FVF and F-FVF
- the consequences if the parties do not adhere to their responsibilities (including proper termination of the relationship)
- a statement requiring the trainee to obtain written permission from their on-site employer or manager, when applicable
- an attestation that all parties will adhere to the Code
- a statement declaring that the trainee and supervisor(s): (a) will retain a copy of the contract and supervision documentation for at least seven years from the date of the final supervision meeting, and (b) will provide all documentation to the BACB if requested

Please note that the original supervision contracts may be amended throughout the supervisory relationship; however, each amendment must be signed and dated by all relevant parties.

📄 **Download our Sample Supervision Contract for BCBA/BCaBA Trainees for guidance in creating your own contract.**

##### Ongoing Documentation of Fieldwork

Because fieldwork varies across settings and practice areas, the BACB gives supervisors and trainees the flexibility to develop their own system for documenting ongoing supervision and fieldwork in a way that demonstrates adherence to all relevant requirements and the Code.

| Independent Hours | Supervised Hours | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| **For each session, document:**<br>• date<br>• start time<br>• end time<br>• fieldwork type<br>• supervisor name<br>• activity category: restricted or unrestricted | **For each supervision contact, document:**<br>• date<br>• start time<br>• end time<br>• fieldwork type<br>• supervision type: individual or group<br>• activity category: restricted or unrestricted<br>• summary of supervision activity (e.g., discussion of activities completed during independent hours, feedback provided, progress toward goals discussed) | **For each observation, document:**<br>• date<br>• start time<br>• end time<br>• fieldwork type<br>• setting name<br>• supervisor name<br>• activity category: restricted or unrestricted |

In addition to tracking data by day and supervision contact, the documentation system should be regularly reviewed to ensure that all relevant requirements are met each supervision period and across all fieldwork hours. This includes tracking:
- **Each Supervisory Period:** The trainee and supervisor should have documentation that shows they are meeting the quantitative requirements (e.g., minimum number of supervisory meetings and contacts) and qualitative requirements (e.g., a summary of what happened during the supervision meeting).
- **Across All Fieldwork Hours:** The trainee should have documentation showing that they are accruing the minimum number of unrestricted hours and making progress.

##### Fieldwork Verification Forms

For every supervision structure, the responsible supervisor and trainee must complete either an Individual Supervision Monthly Fieldwork Verification Form (M-FVF) or a Multiple Supervisors at One Organization Monthly Fieldwork Verification Form (M-FVF) (depending on their supervision structure) every month to document the hours that count for that month. The M-FVF must be signed by the last date of the calendar month following the month of supervision.

At the end of the fieldwork experience under each supervision structure, the responsible supervisor and trainee will use the signed M-FVFs to determine the total hours that can be counted for that fieldwork experience and complete the Individual Supervision Final Fieldwork Verification Form (F-FVF) or a Multiple Supervisors at One Organization Final Fieldwork Verification Form (F-FVF) (depending on their supervision structure). *Note:* Taking a break from accruing fieldwork under the same supervision contract constitutes a new supervision experience.

The F-FVF will be submitted in the certification application, and the M-FVFs may be requested if the fieldwork is audited. Multiple F-FVFs can be submitted in an application to demonstrate that the combined fieldwork experiences meet the total required fieldwork hours.

Both parties must retain a copy of the completed fieldwork forms for at least seven years after obtaining certification. Outdated BACB forms or non-BACB forms will not be accepted. To ensure you are using the most current version, refer to the
