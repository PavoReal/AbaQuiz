# CHAPTER 5: FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT (FBA)

## LEARNER OUTCOMES
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Identify defining features of Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) from current best practice.
- Apply a team-based problem solving process to efficiently conduct a Functional Behavior Assessment that results in the development of a statement that summarizes the context, ABCs & hypothesizes a function of the behavior.

## Introduction
Your work with MO SW-PBS is grounded in the science of behavior or applied behavior analysis (ABA). Applied behavior analysis is the design, implementation, and evaluation of environmental modifications to produce socially significant improvement in behavior (Alberto & Troutman, 2012; Baer, Wolf, & Risley, 1968; Sulzer-Azaroff, B. & Mayer, R., 1991). This is based on the understanding that individuals’ behavior is determined by past and current environmental events. In short, the science of behavior focuses on changes to the environment to result in changed behavior. ABA shows us that we can’t change a person, but we can influence the way they behave by shaping the environment that they function within.

Central to understanding applied behavior analysis is knowing your ABCs–an acronym for the contingency Antecedent–Behavior–Consequence. That is, something happens preceding the behavior (the Antecedent), which in effect causes the Behavior, which then results in Consequences. Antecedents are the happenings that occur before the behavior, anything in the students’ environment that triggers the behavior. Antecedents include cues, prompts, signals, questions or commands from the teacher, as well as reactions from peers that influence student behavior; they are what happens right before the behavior occurs (Crone, Hawken, & Horner, 2015; Crone, Hawken & Horner, 2010). This includes the physical setting, the time of the day, the materials, person or people present, as well as how and what directions are given. Antecedents produce the behavior that follows.

Behavior is any observable act that the student does–the actions or reactions of the student to the environment or antecedents. Simply stated, this is the response from the student to the antecedent conditions. It is visible action. In the classroom it might include performing or doing what is instructed, noncompliant behavior or no response at all.

> “An FBA is a systematic process for studying a student’s behavior using multiple sources of information generated by multiple informants and documenting patterns of behavior over time...”
>
> Simonsen & Meyers, 2015

### A → B → C
The student learns through repeated experience that, under specific Antecedent conditions, engaging in a particular Behavior, will reliably result in a particular Consequence or outcome.

> “If we can identify the conditions under which problem behavior is likely to occur (triggering antecedents and maintaining consequences), we can arrange environments in ways that reduce occurrences of problem behavior and teach and encourage positive behaviors that can replace problem behaviors.” (Sugai et al., 2000 p 137)

The goal is to look for and find patterns within student behavior to identify the function of behavior. A practical and effective process for identifying the function of behavior is called Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA). “The technology of FBA can be used to identify the variables supporting problem behaviors and to rearrange the environment to both reduce problem behaviors and build constructive skills.” (Crone & Horner, 2003, p. xi) Functional Behavior Assessments have produced desired outcomes across a wide range of settings and student behaviors.

- The FBA process has been used effectively in general education settings to reduce problem behaviors, such as noncompliance and task avoidance, as well as to increase desired behaviors, such as academic engagement and participation. (Lane, Weisenbach, Little, Phillips, & Wehby, 2006; Lane et al., 2007)
- In schools that use a three-tiered behavior intervention process (e.g., PBIS), FBA has demonstrated success as a tertiary intervention. (Lane et al., 2007)

Consequences are the results, actions or events that directly follow the behavior. They are the outcome or feedback that occurs immediately following the behavior. In the classroom this includes the reaction of the teacher and peers, which might include attention, specific positive feedback, or correction. Consequences either increase (reinforce) or decrease (punish) the probability that the behavior will occur again in the future (Alberto & Troutman, 2012).

Additionally, there are sometimes Setting Events, which are conditions or circumstances that alter the probability of a behavior occurring. Events that happen outside of the immediate routine that commonly make the problem behavior more likely are Setting Events (Loman, Strickland-Cohen, Borgmeier, & Horner, 2013). For the entire class, a substitute, fire drill, or assembly can be a Setting Event. For an individual student or group of students a Setting Event can be lack of sleep or food, missing the bus or a fight on the bus on the way to school, etc.

Behavior is a form of communication. Unfortunately, some students learn that problem behavior is the most efficient and effective method for them to communicate their needs.

If a student repeatedly engages in problem behavior, he/she is most likely doing it because the behavior is functional or serves a purpose.

## What is a “Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA)?”
Functional Behavior Assessment is a problem-solving process for identifying the events that reliably predict and maintain problem behavior. In general, antecedent events or conditions trigger a specific behavior, while consequence events affect the likelihood the student will repeat the behavior in similar future situations.

The primary objective of the FBA is to gather evidence to develop and support a Summary Statement of the function of behavior and to use this information to design the positive Behavior Intervention Plan.

Functional Behavior Assessment is based upon the following assumptions:

- Challenging behaviors do not occur in a vacuum
- Behaviors occur in response to an identifiable stimuli (antecedent)
- Behaviors are governed by the consequences that follow them
- Behavior is a form of communication (e.g. “I need you to help me.” “This work is too hard.” “Please, talk to me,” etc.)
- Behaviors serve a function & have a purpose:
  - to obtain something (e.g., attention, objects, specific activities)
  - to avoid/escape something (e.g., attention, specific activities)

## FUNCTIONS OF BEHAVIOR
When describing the functions that maintain behavior, Summary Statements (or hypothesis statements) are narrowed to two primary behavioral principles:

1. **Positive reinforcement** is the condition in which a behavior has an increased likelihood of occurring in the future if something (object or event) is given or presented after the behavior occurs.
2. **Negative reinforcement** is the condition in which a behavior has an increased likelihood of occurring in the future if something (object or event) is avoided, escaped, or removed after the behavior occurs.

**Figure 5.1**

| Problem Behavior | Obtain/Get Something | Escape/Avoid Something |
|---|---|---|
| **Positive Reinforcement** | Stimulation/Sensory; Social (Adult, Peer); Tangible/Activity |  |
| **Negative Reinforcement** |  |  |

## CONSIDERATIONS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF BEHAVIOR FUNCTIONS
The theoretical and empirical supports for the behavioral principles of positive and negative reinforcement are extensive in range and depth. Extensions of function-based behavior support to other theoretical approaches and disciplines have not been demonstrated. For example, non-behavioral functions such as, “control,” “authority,” “bullying,” “anger management,” and “intimidation” have been used by schools to describe functions of behavior. These labels are inappropriate because they:

- go beyond the behavioral foundations,
- locate the problem within the students,
- lack empirical verification,
- are not observable and therefore measurable, and
- focus responsibility for change on the student.

Of equal importance, these labels are not useful in the active design of behavior support.

For example, a student who engages in verbal threats and profanity may be viewed as having behaviors that are maintained by “a need for control.” This may lead to intervention strategies to address the “need for control.” Historically this approach to intervention development has not been associated with reduction in problem behavior. Describing behavior as maintained by a “need for control” is not consistent with a function-based logic.

A function-based approach would identify the consequences (events or objects that the student either obtained or avoided) when he or she used verbal threats and profanity. In this example, the student is more likely to engage in problem behaviors when a demand is presented, but he or she is unclear about what to do. The student finds these situations highly aversive, and the problem behavior is associated with rapid removal from the unpleasant context. In this way, the verbal threats and profanity are viewed as maintained by escape from a specific context or demanding situation. The intervention designed to address this hypothesis—avoid task—is likely to be much more targeted, instructive and effective.

The reason for defining the function of problem behaviors is to guide the design of effective and efficient behavior support plans. The more precise the identification of the behavioral function, the more helpful for development of support strategies.

> “FBA is the foundation of positive behavioral support and represents a preferred practice for all students, especially students with problem behaviors. The theoretical and empirical supports for these two behavioral principles are extensive in range and depth.”
>
> Sugai & Horner, 2009 p.1

## WHEN SHOULD AN FBA BE CONDUCTED?*
When a student’s behavior continues to interfere with his or her learning or the learning of others, despite consistent implementation of universal (Tier 1) and targeted intervention strategies (Tier 2), referral for Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) is warranted. The role of the Tier 3 Action Team is to assess the student’s problem behavior, determine the factors that are believed to be associated with occurrence and nonoccurrence of the problem behavior, then use that information to develop an effective Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP).

\*Contact the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Special Education Compliance, to obtain information about the guidelines for determining when to conduct a Functional Behavior Assessment for students with an Individualized Education Plan.

## FBA Components
A Functional Behavior Assessment should result in specific outcomes. These are:

1. A complete Summary Statement
2. Direct observation data to confirm the Summary Statement
3. A Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) based on the Summary Statement

> “A number of procedures exist for conducting a Functional Behavior Assessment, but . . . any appropriate assessment, at minimum, should conclude with three main results.”
>
> Sugai et al., 1999, p.13

## WHAT IS A SUMMARY STATEMENT?
The Summary Statement is a clear, concise way to give a complete and detailed description of the relationships between observable environmental events and the student’s problem behavior(s). A complete Summary Statement must include the following key features:

1. Observable and measurable description of problem behavior(s)
2. Contexts in which the problem behavior is most and least likely to occur
3. Antecedent events that predict when the problem behavior is most likely
4. Consequence events that contribute to maintaining the problem behavior in that routine
5. Setting events that make the problem behavior more intense or more likely to occur
6. Statement of function of problem behavior

These key features are described in detail in the following pages.

A completed Summary Statement can be written using the following format:

During (insert details of the context) when (insert details of the antecedent), (name of the student) is likely to (insert problem behavior) because (insert details of maintaining consequence); therefore, the function of the behavior is to (obtain/avoid). This is more likely to occur when (insert details of setting event).

**Sample Summary Statement:**
During cooperative learning work groups or social group activities when other students are interacting, Jesse is likely to shove others or take their materials because they tell him to stop or push him back; therefore, the function of the behavior is to obtain peer attention. This is more likely to occur when students have not included Jesse in group activities earlier in the day.

# KEY FEATURES OF THE SUMMARY STATEMENT

## 1. OBSERVABLE & MEASURABLE DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM BEHAVIOR
A summary statement must first include an observable and measurable description of the problem behavior

- **Observable** – Describe specific student actions that can be seen or heard, using such precise language that the actions can be replicated by a stranger (e.g. the student yelled curse words, rather than the student used inappropriate language.)
- **Measurable** – Report behaviors that have an observable beginning & end and can be counted or timed (e.g., The student yelled curse words 7 times in one hour, rather than the student often used inappropriate language.)

### Examples of observable descriptions of behavior

| General Category | Observable Description |
|---|---|
| Defiant | - Tells adults, “No!”<br>- Yells, “I won’t do it!”<br>- Uses profanity |
| Disruptive | - Talks loudly while another person is speaking<br>- Beats loudly on the desk |
| Physically Aggressive | - Throws supplies off desk<br>- Pushes peers<br>- Hits peers |
| Noncompliant | - Remains seated after being directed to move to another location<br>- Leaves materials in desk when directed to get out supplies to start work. |

### Activity
Write yes beside each behavior that is described in observable terms. Write no beside each behavior that is not described in observable terms.

| Description of Behavior | Observable? |
|---|---|
| 1. Julia is unmotivated to complete her work. |  |
| 2. Derek completes assigned writing tasks. |  |
| 3. Erin is often off-task during science and math class. |  |
| 4. Joel gets out of his seat and walks around the room during science and math class. |  |

### Measurable dimensions include
Which dimension of behavior should be selected to measure the problem behavior? The team should first select an indicator or indicators that best reflect the behaviors that are most important, then determine which characteristics of behavior should be measured.

| Dimension | Definition | When it Should Be Used | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frequency | Number of times an individual engages in a behavior within an observation period | When the behavior that is being studied can be easily counted, but not at such a high rate that it is hard to document | Leaving the area, hitting another peer, throwing items, raising one’s hand, yelling out answers, asking to go to the bathroom, being late to class |
| Duration | How long an individual engages in a behavior | When a behavior occurs at a high rate or occurs over extended periods of time | Out of seat behavior, crying, actively on task |
| Intensity | Extent to which the behavior impacts the child and/or the classroom | When the magnitude or impact of the behavior is more relevant than the frequency or duration of the problem behavior | Hitting another peer, destruction of property, self-injury |

**Activity**
Work with a partner to select the dimension of behavior that your team deems most appropriate to measurably describe the behavior. Be ready to justify your selection.

| Behavior | Measurable Dimension |
|---|---|
| 1. Eric calls other students names like “freak” or “dummy.” |  |
| 2. Luke pushes other students during recess. |  |
| 3. Julia makes noises in class during independent work time. |  |
| 4. Marcus is able to get out all materials and start work tasks as directed. He is only able to continue working on the task for a very short period of time. |  |

### Activity: Create an observable and measurable description
Create an observable and measurable description for the problem behaviors below.  
*Adapted from Loman & Borgmeier, 2010*

| Problem Behavior (Obtained from ODR) | What does it look like (Observable) | Frequency | Intensity | Duration (Measurable) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Student is disrespectful to all adults. |  |  |  |  |
| Student is defiant when she is given a direction. |  |  |  |  |

**Activity**
Complete an observable and measurable description of the problem behavior of a student with whom you work that you believe may meet identification criteria for Tier 3 Intervention.

| Problem Behavior (Obtained from ODR) | What does it look like (Observable Topography) | Frequency | Intensity | Duration (Measurable) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

# Prioritizing Problem Behaviors
When the Action Team begins the process of developing a Summary Statement, it is possible to identify more than one problem behavior. Prioritizing possible target behaviors will help your Tier 3 Action Team make an informed decision about which behavior(s) should be the focus of the Behavior Intervention Plan. The following are considerations when prioritizing which behaviors should be targeted first:

- **INTENSITY** – How severe/intense is the behavior that the student is exhibiting? Does it put the student or others in danger? Behaviors that cause or threaten to cause physical injury to the student or others should receive top priority. Consider conducting a complex FBA/BIP process when safety is a concern. The simple FBA process in this workbook is not intended to address dangerous behaviors.
- **FREQUENCY** – How often does the problem behavior occur? Behaviors that occur with high frequency and consistency may present more of a problem than behaviors that only occur intermittently. Also consider the frequency of opportunities for the student to perform the replacement behavior. For example students perform the expected behaviors for entering and leaving the classroom on a daily basis, however the expected behavior for entering and leaving the classroom in case of a fire drill is different, and is used far less frequently.
- **CHRONIC NEED** – How long has the behavior been occurring and/or how long has the student been lacking the replacement skill? Behaviors that have been occurring over long periods of time should take precedence over behaviors that have only recently begun to occur.
- **PREREQUISITE FOR OTHER SKILLS** – The relationship of the targeted behavior to other expected behaviors should be considered when selecting which behavior to target first. Expected behaviors that are a prerequisite for long-term desired behaviors should take top priority. For example, if the expectation for the student is to work with peers and contribute to assignments given when in collaborative groups, prerequisite skills might include listening and attending to task, speaking kindly to peers, beginning work right away, and asking for help when needed.
- **DURATION** – What length of time does the student exhibit the targeted behavior? Behaviors that occur for long stretches of time over the school day should take precedence over behaviors that are shorter in duration.

When prioritizing, group problem behaviors together for consideration based on similar function whenever possible. For example, if a student has several physical behaviors (biting, hitting, kicking) that all serve the function of attaining peer attention, those behaviors may be grouped together on the Prioritizing Behaviors Chart, and on the Behavior Intervention Plan as well.

## Prioritizing Scenario Freda Example
After gathering information, the Action Team found some interesting patterns in Freda’s behavior. When given independent tasks involving reading, Freda would wander the room, fiddle with things in her desk, or appear to be reading but pages did not get turned. It was obvious to the team that the function of these behaviors was to escape tasks. During group work, Freda was physically aggressive (pushing, kicking) or said mean things to others (“get away”, “don’t touch my stuff ”). When this happened, she was asked to work with a familiar partner, which she was very willing to do. They were also seeing this set of behaviors during lunch, recess, and other unstructured times. For this group of behaviors, it was concluded that the function was to obtain peer attention. To determine which set of behaviors to write a BIP for, the action team met and discussed the intensity, frequency, duration, if any replacement behaviors were prerequisite for others, and how chronic the two sets of behavior were. They used the Prioritizing Behaviors Chart to decide where to start.

### Prioritizing Behaviors Chart (Freda Example)
| Prioritization Criteria | Escape task behaviors (wandering, playing in desk, staring at materials but not working) | Obtain peer attention (physically aggressive toward peers, say mean things) | _______________ | _______________ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intensity | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 |
| Frequency | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 |
| Chronic Need | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 |
| Pre-requisite for other functional skills | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 |
| Duration | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 |
| **Order of priority?** | _____ | _____ | _____ | _____ |

When prioritizing, the Tier 3 Action Team should place each behavior, or group of behaviors, to be considered in a column on the Prioritizing Behaviors Chart. Circle the number to rate each problem behavior according to the Prioritization Criteria in each row. Rank from low (1) to high (5). Use this information to structure dialog regarding which problem behavior to focus on for further FBA/BIP analysis. Use the bottom row to indicate the order in which the team will address the behaviors. A form template is available at the end of the chapter for your use.

After examining the chart, the team decided to focus Freda’s BIP on obtaining peer attention, with a replacement behavior of being respectful to others as defined by using kind words and keeping her hands and feet to herself. Not only were the behaviors more highly rated, but considering the amount of group work/cooperative learning in Freda’s classroom, and the problems Freda was also having in less structured areas, her social skills deficits were having a major impact on Freda’s success in school. Rather than ignore Freda’s problems with tasks involving reading, the team discussed additional academic supports that could be provided with her teachers.

## STAY FOCUSED ON THE FUNCTION
Effective interventions cannot be based solely on the description of the problem behavior. Because all behavior serves a specific function, students learn to behave in ways that satisfy a need or result in a desired outcome.

Although the topography of the behavior (i.e., what the behavior looks like or sounds like) across several students may be similar, the function of the behaviors may be very different. For example, Julia and Debra may both make inappropriate comments like, “This is so lame,” to the teacher while he is giving instructions during math class. However, Julia may be seeking peer attention while Debra may be trying to escape the math task.

Even though both students engage in the same behavior, the behavior serves a different function for each student. Simply focusing on the description of the problem behavior does not provide information about the environmental factors that occasion and support it. Therefore, we cannot develop effective interventions based solely on the description of the problem behavior. Behavior must be considered in the context in which it occurs.

---

# 2. KEY FEATURES OF A SUMMARY STATEMENT: CONTEXT
After the Action Team identifies, describes, and prioritizes the problem behavior(s), the Action Team must identify the context in which the problem behavior occurs. This information is critical to identify the function of the behavior.

**Context** refers to the activities and routines in which the problem behavior is most and least likely to occur. Identifying the context allows the Action Team to identify events that predict when, where, and under what conditions the problem behavior occurs. Equally important are the conditions under which the problem behavior does not occur.

The process of identifying the context of behavior begins with recording the student’s schedule of activities. The student’s teachers rate the likelihood of the problem behavior occurring in each activity throughout the day. By examining the patterns of problem behavior, the Action Team can begin to note specific situations where antecedents and consequences make the problem behavior more likely, as well as identifying naturally occurring situations where problem behavior is unlikely.

### Context Analysis Table (Adapted FACTS – Part A format)
| **Context** |  | **Problem Behavior** | **Consequence** |

|  |  | 1 2 3 4 5 6 |  |

# 3. KEY FEATURES OF A SUMMARY STATEMENT: ANTECEDENT EVENTS
Antecedent events happen immediately before and set the occasion for or trigger the problem behavior (Crone & Horner, 2003). Identification of the antecedent is important for 2 reasons:

1. It allows one to predict when problem behavior will occur.
2. Changing the antecedents will likely result in changing the behavior.

Some of the most common antecedent events are:

- Task is too difficult
- Peer or adult attention/interaction
- Transitions from one activity to another
- Lack of access/availability of specific item or activity/task
- Lack of peer or adult attention/interaction

Antecedent events can be identified by asking the following questions:

- What types of activities might be occurring within a specific context?
  - Independent seat work
  - Large group instruction
  - Small cooperative work groups
- Which peers or adults are present in this context?
- What tasks are most commonly assigned during this context?
  - Tasks that require memorization (e.g. math facts, spelling, etc.)
  - Tasks that require mastery of specific skills such as reading, decoding or writing a sentence

### Practice: Identify behavior, context & antecedent
Identify the behavior, context & antecedent in the following scenario.

> When Lucia goes to math class and is directed to complete computation problems, Lucia stares at the teacher and rips the paper.

- Context: During _________________________________________________
- Antecedent<br>When:
- Behavior<br>Student does:

---

# 4. KEY FEATURES OF A SUMMARY STATEMENT: CONSEQUENCE EVENTS
Consequence events follow a behavior. They include reinforcers, punishers and neutral consequences.

- **Reinforcer:** A reinforcer is something that happens directly after a behavior occurs and increases the probability that the behavior will occur again.
  - When there is an increase in behavior to access the reinforcer, that is **positive reinforcement**
  - When a student increases a behavior to avoid an aversive reinforcer (e.g. difficult academic task, social interaction), that is **negative reinforcement**
- **Punisher:** A punisher is something that happens directly after a behavior occurs and decreases the probability the behavior will occur again (not to be confused with negative reinforcement).
- **Neutral consequence:** A neutral consequence is something that happens directly after a behavior occurs, but does not change the probability of occurrence of a behavior.

A **maintaining consequence** is a reinforcer; something that occurs immediately after a behavior and increases the likelihood the problem behavior will occur again. The most common maintaining consequences are listed below:

- Adult or peer responds to student
- Removal of teacher or peer attention
- Increased access/availability of preferred activity/task
- Removal of activity/task

Maintaining consequence events can be identified by asking the following questions:

- What consequence reliably follows the problem behavior?
  - What do peers do (e.g., look, laugh, talk, walk away)?
  - What does the teacher do (e.g., redirect, reteach behavior, provide academic assistance)?
  - Would the student continue to engage in the problem behavior even if the consequence was removed or had not occurred?

---

# 5. KEY FEATURES OF A SUMMARY STATEMENT: SETTING EVENTS
Setting events are situations unique to an individual that make the problem behavior more intense or more likely to occur. Setting events affect how a student will respond to situations by temporarily increasing or decreasing reinforcers in the environment. Setting events can occur immediately before a problem behavior or days in advance. Some setting events are obvious while other setting events can be more difficult to identify. For example, the death of a close family member that occurred before school started can increase the likelihood the student will engage in problem behavior a few months later when school starts.

Some common setting events are listed below:

- Student is not feeling well (stomachache, headache, sore ear, etc)
- Student is tired or hungry
- Student has had a negative interaction with someone earlier in the day
- Student has regular difficulty with the subject matter

---

# 6. KEY FEATURES OF A SUMMARY STATEMENT: FUNCTION OF BEHAVIOR
The function of behavior refers to the purpose or intent of the student’s actions. The function of the behavior may be to obtain something or to escape something.

Studies that have compiled data on the prevalence of behavioral function show attention maintained problem behavior in only about one quarter to one third of the cases examined (Derby et al., 1992; Hanley, Iwata & McCord, 2003; Iwata, et al., 1994). The Functional Behavior Assessment process allows teams to look more closely at the context of the behavior to go beyond surface level guessing, and avoid wrongly identifying attention-seeking as the function.

### Practice: Identify the behavior, context, antecedent & consequence
Identify the behavior, context, antecedent & consequence in the following scenario.

> Josey puts her head down when peers talk to her during group activities. This results in peers walking away from her.

- Context: During __________________________________________________________________
- Antecedent<br>When:
- Behavior<br>Student does:
- Consequence<br>Because this happens:

The team infers or “hypothesizes” the purpose of the student’s actions by identifying patterns between the setting events, antecedents and maintaining consequence events and the student’s behavior.

**Caution:** A behavior may serve more than one function for the same individual. For example, a student may call other students names during lunch to access peer attention or interaction. The same student may call other students names during math class to escape or avoid the assigned task. If a behavior serves more than one function for the same individual, or if the individual exhibits different behaviors that serve more than one function, the FBA team will need to develop two Summary Statements.

### Practice: Developing a Summary Statement for Glen
Identify the behavior, context, antecedent, consequence and setting event in the following scenario. Analyze the information to hypothesize a function of behavior, then write a Summary Statement using this information.

> Glen shoves his book and rips his paper when the teacher directs students to begin work on independent math assignments. This results in removal from the work area to a time out area. Glen is more likely to engage in this behavior after he’s had difficulty with similar tasks the previous day.

- Context: During ___________________________________________________________________
- Antecedent<br>When:

Summary Statement frame:

During _______________________ when _____________________________, Glen is likely to __________________________________________________________________ because _________________________________; therefore, the function of the behavior is to _________________________________________.
This is more likely to occur when __________________________________________________.

# FBA Process

## How will we get the information to generate a Summary Statement?
- Review or examine the student’s records.
- Interview teachers, student and family.
- Observe the student in settings identified through the context analysis.

The flow chart on the next page lists each step of the FBA process. The remainder of the chapter will describe each step in detail.

## Functional Behavior Assessment Flow Chart
1. **STEP 1:** Core Team identifies student and a Core Team member is identified as the Action Team facilitator.
2. **STEP 2:** Core Team identifies and notifies FBA/BIP Action Team members.
3. **STEP 3:** Action Team facilitator does record review.
4. **STEP 4:** Action team member(s) interview teachers, staff, student and family.
5. **STEP 5:** Action team (Meeting 1) develops an initial Summary Statement.
6. **STEP 6:** Action team conducts observations to clarify, adjust or confirm Summary Statement.
7. **STEP 7:** Action team (Meeting 2) uses information from observations to confirm final Summary Statement, and develop Behavior Intervention Plan.

# FBA Process – Step 1: Student Identification
The first step in the FBA process involves the Core Team identifying a student who exhibits a pattern of problem behavior that impedes his/her learning, or the learning of others. This behavior persists despite implementation of school or classroom intervention strategies. One Core Team member is identified as the Action Team facilitator.

When identifying students for Tier 3 intervention, the Core Team may consider nonresponse to Tier 2 intervention, a data decision rule for chronic and/or intense problem behavior, teacher nomination or screening instrument scores. Developing a system to identify students who may require and benefit from Tier 3 intervention is described in detail in Chapter 4 of this workbook.

# FBA Process – Step 2: Identify Action Team Members
Once the Tier 3 Core Team has determined that a student meets the criteria for individualized intervention, the team identifies the Action Team for that student. Identification of Action Team members who will conduct the FBA and develop the BIP is described in detail in Chapter 3 of this workbook. The Core Team will fill out sections 1 and 2 on the Tier 3 Student File Checklist with the team member names and roles, the student’s information, and the status of the file.

# FBA Process – Step 3: Record Review
In a record review, a Core Team member reviews relevant records to obtain information about attendance, academic performance (grades, academic assessment, response to previous intervention) and social behavioral performance (office referrals, classroom minors, screening information, response to previous intervention).

A record review provides important information about a student’s academic and behavioral history. Completing the record review early in the Functional Behavior Assessment process will provide information that will assist the team to clearly and measurably describe the problem behavior. It can also provide clues to variables that are affecting the behavior that may not be immediately obvious.

School teams must develop an efficient and effective process for collecting relevant student information. Identifying the information that will be collected for each student will increase efficiency of the record review. A tool developed to guide functional assessment interviews, the Functional Assessment Checklist for Teachers and Staff (FACTS) (March et al., 2000), has been adapted by MO SW-PBS to include a structured format for collection of relevant student information. MO SW-PBS utilized the guidelines provided by Watson and Steege (2003) and Sugai et al., (1999) to identify information included in the record review.

Once the Core Team identifies the information that will be collected for each student, a consistent collection procedure must be developed. In other words, the Core Team must establish who will collect the information and how it will be collected.

Many Missouri schools include the responsibility of student record review into one of the existing Core Team roles. This Core Team member acts as a coordinator of the record review process and is responsible for obtaining student information from each source. Once the information has been collected, the team member notes on the Tier 3 Student File Checklist the date and location (if keeping digital files) of the record review.

Teams record the date the information was generated (i.e. the date the Office Referrals were collected, the date the reading assessment was administered) in the second column. A summary of the information from each source is recorded in the third column.

# FBA Process – Step 4: Interview
The purpose of the FBA interview is to obtain more specific information about the problem behavior and the conditions under which it is most likely and least likely to occur. Comprehensive interviews also provide valuable information to guide the development of effective intervention plans.

Interviews should be conducted with the student, family, teachers, support staff, and other relevant persons who work with or know the student well. Incorporating information from multiple sources improves the accuracy and validity of the information received. Structuring the interview using a predetermined set of questions and presenting them in a standard format facilitates comparison of results across informants.

## Family Interview
1. Describe a typical day for your child.
2. What does your child do after school when he or she gets home each day?
3. Does he spend time with friends or people his or her own age?
4. What does he or she say about what’s happening in school?
5. What are some of your child’s challenges?
6. What are some things your child does very well?
7. What are your goals for your child at home and school?

## Student Interview
1. Describe a typical day for you.
2. What do you like to do after school when you get home each day?
3. (Ask a follow-up question about what the student likes to do.)
4. Do you spend time with friends or people your own age?
5. What is your favorite class in school?
6. What do you like about that class?
7. Do you have people in your classes that you like to work with?
8. What are some things you have trouble with?
9. What are some things you do very well?
10. What are your goals for yourself at home and school?

Both Family Interview and Student Interview form template are available at the end of the chapter for your use.

## Recording Responses from Teacher/Staff Interviews
Several of the Teacher/Staff interview questions for teachers are designed to be directly recorded on the Adapted FACTS - Part A to streamline the process of creating the Summary Statement. The chart below provides information about recording information from staff interviews.

| Interview Question | Purpose | Where to Record Responses |

Include times between classes, lunch, before school and adapt for complex schedule features (e.g. odd/even days) if appropriate. | Identify the general context of problem behavior | Adapted FACTS Part A, p. 2, Column 1: Schedule |
| 3. For each time listed, indicate the activity in which the student is typically engaged (e.g. small group instruction, independent writing activity, transition, etc.). | Provide more detail about the context of problem behavior and gather information to inform antecedent events | Adapted FACTS Part A, p. 2, Column 2: Activity |
| 4. What is the likelihood of the behavior occurring during each time period? | Identify times/activities most likely & least likely to be associated with problem behavior | Adapted FACTS Part A, p. 2, Column 3: Likelihood of Problem |
| 5. What is the most common response to the problem behavior? | Identify the consequence occurring most often after problem behavior | Adapted FACTS Part A, p. 2, Column 4: Consequence |
| 6. What type of activity does the student choose when engaged in “free time?” | Identify possible reinforcing consequence for appropriate behavior | Teacher/Staff Interview Form |
| 7. What are some of the student’s challenges? | Identify staff perception of student functioning | Teacher/Staff Interview Form |
| 8. What are some things the student does very well? | Identify possible strategies to prevent problem behavior and to reinforce appropriate behavior | Adapted FACTS Part A, p. 1: Description of Strengths; Teacher/Staff Interview Form |
| 9. What are your goals for the student? | Provide positive focus for BIP development | Teacher/Staff Interview Form |

# Identify the Target Contexts
- Identify those contexts with the highest ratings (contexts rated 4, 5 or 6).
- Select contexts for further analysis and prioritize which context to assess first.
- Highlight the highest priority context

**Note:** In some cases, it may be possible to combine multiple contexts, but only when the structure and demands within the context are very similar (Loman & Borgmeier, 2010).

Examples of combined/multiple contexts:

- Consistent problem behavior in recess, lunch and free-time might be combined into unstructured times with peers
- Consistent problem behavior in reading and social studies primarily during whole group instruction might be combined into large group reading.

**List the Activities/Context in order of Priority for Behavior Support:** Select routines with ratings of 4, 5 or 6:  
(Only combine routines when there is significant (a) similarity of activities (conditions) and (b) similarity of problem behavior(s).)

- Problem Behavior: _____________________ is most likely to occur during _____________________. *(Activity)*
- Problem Behavior: _____________________ is least likely to occur during _____________________. *(Activity)*

Complete the Adapted FACTS – Part B on the next page for each of the prioritized context(s).

Once information from the record review and interviews is presented, the Action Team works together to analyze the information to identify the antecedent, maintaining consequence and setting event(s). The Adapted FACTS – Part B provides a structured format for analysis.

# Suzy Example: Context Analysis (Adapted FACTS - Part A)
Suzy’s other teachers (specials, lunch supervisor) were interviewed with similar questions, however, no problem behaviors were indicated at those times. The results were entered in page 2 of the Adapted FACTS - Part A, Context Analysis:

| Schedule (Time & Subject) | Activity | Likelihood of Problem (Low–High) | What is the response to the problem behavior? (Write #) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8:00 Reading | Lg. Group Rdg Circle | Circle 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 1 - Adults redirect and reteach |
|  | Sm. Group Stations | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2 - Peers respond, then,<br>6 - Student is moved to work in timeout area |
|  | Independent | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2 - Peers respond<br>7 - Student sent to timeout |
| 9:30 Writing | Independent | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2 - Peers respond<br>7 - Student sent to timeout |
| 10:30 Specials | Lg. Group | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | No problem behavior noted during this time. |
| 11:00 Science | Small Group Lab | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2 - Peers respond. |
| 12:00 Lunch | Lg. Group | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | No problem behavior noted during this time. |
| 1:00 Math | Lg. Group | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2, |
|  | Independent | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2,7 |
| 2:00 SS | Lg Group | 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2,7 |

**Suzy’s context analysis summary might look like this:**
- Problem Behavior: Talking out is most likely to occur during Independent work. *(Activity)*
- Problem Behavior: Talking out is least likely to occur during unstructured times and Specials. *(Activity)*

# FBA Process – Step 5: Develop an initial Summary Statement (Action Team Meeting 1)
All members of the Action Team meet to analyze information collected from the record review and interviews. Prior to the meeting, the Action Team facilitator uses the information from the Adapted FACTS - Part A to complete the summary statement components on the Adapted FACTS - Part B. Each component is described in further detail in the following pages.

## Adapted FACTS - Part B

### SECTION 5: DESCRIPTION OF THE ANTECEDENT
- Identify all antecedents that apply to the target context.
- Rank order the 2 strongest predictors from those selected.

| Antecedents (Rank order top 2 predictors) | Follow Up Questions – Be as Specific as possible |
|---|---|
| ___a. Large Group Activity | If a, b, c, d or e– Describe setting/activity/context in detail<br>________________________________________________<br>________________________________________________ |
| ___b. Small Group Activity |  |
| ___c. Independent Activity |  |
| ___d. Transition |  |
| ___e. Unstructured Activity |  |
| ___f. Task too hard | If f, g, h, or i – Describe task/demand in detail<br>________________________________________________<br>________________________________________________ |
| ___g. Task too easy |  |
| ___h. Task too long |  |
| ___i. Physical Demand |  |
| ___j. Correction/reprimand | If j – Describe purpose of correction, voice tone, volume<br>________________________________________________ |

#### Follow-up Questions
After identifying the strongest predictor(s), or the antecedents most likely to lead to the problem behavior, ask follow-up question(s) that correspond with the letter of the item(s) rank ordered #1 and #2. The Action Team facilitator may need to ask additional questions to obtain a clear understanding of the antecedents triggering the problem behavior.

**Example of Additional Follow-Up:**
Is the description of the antecedent clear enough that the team can identify specific environmental modifications to prevent the problem behavior?

Identifying “task too hard” and answering “reading” to the follow-up questions is probably not sufficient to inform intervention development. It is essential to know specifically the type of reading tasks that are too difficult and what skills the student does or does not possess.

A better description of the difficulty of the task would be, “The student is able to identify the sound of each letter and can blend CVC words, but is not fluent with multisyllabic words, nor most irregular words. Specifically, the student cannot answer comprehension questions nor read aloud in content areas or literacy higher than a 1st grade level.” (Loman & Borgmeier, 2010)

**SUZY EXAMPLE**
- (Rank order shown) **2**, **1**
- Any task in which Suzy is not working with her friends

### SECTION 6: DESCRIPTION OF THE CONSEQUENCE
- Identify all consequences that apply to the target context.
- Rank order the 2 strongest consequences from those selected.

#### Follow-up Questions
After identifying the strongest consequence(s) ask the follow-up question(s) that correspond with the letter of the item(s) rank ordered #1 and #2. The Action Team facilitator may need to ask additional questions to obtain a clear understanding of the consequences maintaining the problem behavior.

Before addressing the next section ask the following question about the consequence responses:

Would the problem behavior continue even if the consequence did not occur? If attention was never given for the behavior, would the student still demonstrate the problem behavior?

| Consequences (Rank order top 2 consequences) | Follow-Up Questions – Be as Specific as possible |
|---|---|
| ___a. adult(s) respond (look at or talk to student) | If a or b – Which adults or peers respond?<br>__________________________________________________<br>How did the adults or peers respond?<br>__________________________________________________ |
| ___b. peer(s) respond (look at, laugh or talk to student) |  |
| ___c. get specific activity | If c, d or e – What specific item, activity or sensory input did the child get?<br>_______________________________________ |
| ___d. get specific object |  |
| ___e. get specific sensory input |  |
| ___f. removed from adult(s) | If f or g – From which adults or peers was the child removed?<br>__________________________________________________ |
| ___g. removed from peer(s) |  |
| ___h. specific activity removed | If h or I – Describe specific task/activity/sensory input removed.<br>__________________________________________<br>(Specifically describe the type of work within subject areas)<br><br>Can the student independently perform the task? **Y N**<br>Is further assessment needed to ID specific skill deficits? **Y N** |
| ___i. specific sensory input removed |  |

**SUZY EXAMPLE**
- (Rank order shown) **2**, **1**
- Suzy’s friends
- independent reading and writing

### SECTION 7: SETTING EVENT(S)
- Identify all setting events in the list that apply.
- Rank order the strongest setting events from those selected.

**SETTING EVENT(s):** Rank order any events that happen outside of the immediate context (at home or earlier in the day) that commonly make problem behavior more likely or worse in the context described above.

- ___ hunger
- ___ lack of sleep
- ___ illness
- ___ missed medication
- ___ conflict at home
- ___ conflict at school
- ___ homework not done
- ___ change in routine
- ___ failure in previous class

#### Follow-up Questions
After identifying the most common setting events ask questions that will provide a clearer picture of the impact and occurrence of setting events.

How often does the student come to school hungry? Does the family have the student’s medication and just have trouble remembering to give it regularly, or do they need assistance getting access to medical help?

**Suzy Example:** It was noted during teacher interviews that Suzy is more likely to joke and talk when specific friends are present. This is the only setting event noted.

- peers laugh and look at Suzy

---

# Identify the Function of Behavior
- Examine the identified antecedent and consequence events in each context to identify patterns. Ask the following questions:
  - Does the problem behavior consistently result in the student obtaining something or does it result in the student escaping something?
  - Do the antecedent and function make sense when considered together?

**Example**  
If the function appears to be avoiding difficult tasks, it would make sense that the antecedent is a specific task that is too difficult. It would not make sense if the function appears to be to escape a difficult task and the antecedent is unstructured time with peers (Loman & Borgmeier, 2010).

## SECTION 8: SUMMARY STATEMENT
Write the top ranked responses and follow-up responses from the Antecedent, Consequence and Setting Event sections of the Adapted FACTS – Part B.

### Summary Statement Pathway (template)
| ANTECEDENT(s)/Triggers | PROBLEM BEHAVIOR(s) | CONSEQUENCE(s)/Function |
|---|---|---|
| When this happens . . . | Student will . . . . | Because this happens . . .<br><br>Therefore the function is to obtain/avoid ___________________ |
| **SETTING EVENT** |  |  |

### Summary Statement Pathway (example filled)
| ANTECEDENT(s)/Triggers | PROBLEM BEHAVIOR(s) | CONSEQUENCE(s)/Function |
|---|---|---|
| When asked to do independent work | Joke, talk out, and disrupt class | Peers laugh and respond<br><br>Therefore the function is to obtain/avoid ___________________ |
| When certain peers are around |  |  |

Using the information from the Adapted FACTS - Part B, the Action Team records Suzy's information into the table.

**SUZY EXAMPLE**
- peer attention

---

# Summary Statement Format + Confidence Rating
Copy the information from the pathway found at the bottom of the Adapted FACTS – Part B into the following format:

During (Context = _______________________) when (Antecedent = ________________________) the student will (Problem Behavior = ________________) because (Consequence = _________________); therefore, the function of the behavior is to (obtain/avoid ______________).  
This is more likely to occur when (Setting = ____________________________).

**Suzy Example: Suzy’s initial Summary Statement:**
During (Context) content area classes when (Antecedent) Suzy is asked to work independently the student will (Problem Behavior) joke, talk out, disrupt because (Consequence) peers laugh and respond; therefore, the function of the behavior is to (obtain/avoid) obtain peer attention. This is more likely to occur when (Setting) specific friends are around.

## Rate confidence in initial Summary Statement
The team rates the level of confidence in the accuracy of the Summary Statement’s description of the relationship between the problem behavior and environmental events. A rating of 1, 2 or 3 indicates that the team does not have enough information to accurately identify antecedent and consequence events. A rating of 4, 5 or 6 indicates that the team is confident that the antecedent and consequence events have been accurately identified.

**Suzy Example:** The team felt very confident (6) that Suzy’s Summary Statement accurately reflected the pattern of problem behavior.

How confident are you that your Summary Statement accurately explains the problem behavior occurring?

Not at all — So-so — Very confident  
1 2 3 4 5 6

---

# FBA Process – Step 6: Observation
After the initial Summary Statement has been developed, the Action Team determines how confident they are that their hypothesis of antecedents and consequences surrounding the problem behavior is accurate. If the rating of confidence is 4, 5, or 6, the Action Team schedules an observation to verify the accuracy of the initial Summary Statement. If the rating of confidence is 1, 2, or 3, the purpose of the observation is to collect additional information to identify antecedents and consequences so that an accurate Summary Statement can be generated.

## GUIDELINES FOR OBSERVATIONS
Sit in an area of the room where you can see the child but are as unobtrusive as possible. If the behavior does not occur, schedule another observation. If you believe your presence is preventing the behavior from occurring, find another individual to observe. Observe for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.

## FBA OBSERVATION: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
1. **Where do I sit when I enter the room?**  
   A: Enter the room quietly, not interacting with students. Sit near enough to the student to see and hear, but not so close that it is obvious you are watching him or her.
2. **What if the student or students ask why I am there?**  
   A: You can tell them you are there to learn more about what is being taught in the class.
3. **How many times should I observe the student in the routine?**  
   A: Observe until you are convinced (about 5 to10 occurrences of behavior OR 3 to 1 ratio of occurrences verifying FACTS summary). You may have to go in on more than one day or period, but make sure you are going during identified activity.
4. **For what period of time should I observe?**  
   A: This should be based on the FACTS interview results. About 15-20 minutes per routine is acceptable. You want to observe until you are convinced (e.g. record at least 5 occurrences of problem behavior).

## CONFIRMING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT
To confirm the Summary Statement, observations should be scheduled during times when the behavior is most likely to occur. The team will utilize information obtained during the team meeting to schedule 15–20 minute observations within contexts identified as problematic by the Adapted FACTS – Part A.

An ABC Observation Form may be used to aid in the process. The Summary Statement developed during the Action Team meeting and recorded at the bottom of p. 3 of the Adapted FACTS – Part B is written at the top of the ABC Observation Form.

When the identified problem behavior is demonstrated, the observer records the specific behavior in the middle of the form. They then check the box or boxes corresponding to the antecedent(s) observed to occur immediately before the behavior, and the corresponding box or boxes indicating what happened immediately following the problem behavior (consequence). This pattern should be followed each time the problem behavior is observed; the specific behavior is recorded, the antecedents and consequences checked, until the 15 to 20-minute observation is completed. The patterns should then be summarized at the bottom of the observation form.

### Discussion
- Who in your building can conduct observations?
- How will observations be scheduled and teachers notified?
- Does your team understand how to conduct observations using the ABC Observation Form

An ABC Observation Form template is available at the end of the chapter for your use. Suzy’s ABC Observation Form is on the following page.

## Determining Alignment (Observation vs. Summary Statement)
The Action Team uses the following questions to determine if the Summary Statement generated prior to the observations aligns with the information collected during the observation:

- Does the behavior observed match the description of problem behavior?
- Does the problem behavior occur during anticipated contexts?
- Do identified antecedents precede the problem behavior
- Is the problem behavior followed by identified consequences?
- Can you confirm the function?

If the observation confirms the Summary Statement celebrate the accuracy and efficiency of your process and begin developing the BIP. If the observation does not match the Summary Statement, use the observation to analyze and revise the Summary Statement and schedule additional observations.

## COLLECTING MORE INFORMATION TO DEVELOP A SUMMARY STATEMENT
If the team lacks confidence or is unable to write a Summary Statement based on the information and data collected (Adapted FACTS part A), observations are needed. If teachers have provided conflicting information concerning any aspects of the Summary Statement, or if no patterns emerged from the information collected, observations will aid in establishing those needed pieces so an accurate summary statement may be written. The Summary Statement is the basis of the Behavior Intervention Plan and must be accurate for an effective plan to be developed. These observations may use the same ABC form and follow the same process except one may wish to observe those contexts where the problem behavior does NOT occur as well as those where the behavior is more likely to occur so patterns emerge. Observations should be conducted until a Summary Statement can be written and the team has a confidence rating of 4, 5 or 6.

3. A summary of the information from each source is recorded in the third column. This summary includes relevant dates (i.e. dates of referrals, date assessments were administered).

## SECTION 4: CONTEXT ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL/BEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE
1. List the times that define the student’s daily schedule in Column 1. Include times between classes, lunch, before school and adapt for complex schedule features (e.g. odd/even days) if appropriate in the first column.  
2. Interview the student’s teachers to identify the type of activity that most often occurs during each time/subject and record that information in Column 2.  
3. Interview the student’s teachers to identify the problem behavior displayed during each time period and the likelihood the problem behavior will occur. Record this information in Column 3. The following scale may be used as an example to identify the value of each rating:  
   - 1 = Less than one time/month  
   - 2 = 1 time/week  
   - 3 = 2-3 times/week  
   - 4 = 1 time/day  
   - 5 = 3-4 times/day  
   - 6 = At least one time each hour  
4. Interview the student’s teachers to identify the most frequent adult/peer response to the problem behavior. Record this information in Column 4.  
   1. Adult(s) respond (Redirect, Reteach Behavior, or Provide Assistance)  
   2. Peer(s) respond (look at, laugh or talk to student)  
   3. Student obtains specific object/item  
   4. Adult(s) withhold/remove interaction  
   5. Peer(s) withhold/remove interaction  
   6. Activity/task is changed  
   7. Student sent to timeout or office  

Identify those contexts with the highest ratings (contexts rated 4, 5 or 6). At the bottom of p. 2, write the context where the problem behavior is most likely to occur and the context where the problem behavior is least likely to occur.

# Adapted FACTS – Part B Instructions

## SECTION 5: DESCRIPTION OF THE ANTECEDENT
- Identify all antecedents that apply to the target context.  
- Rank order the 2 strongest predictors from those selected.  
- After identifying the strongest predictor(s) ask the follow-up question(s) that correspond with the letter of the item(s) rank ordered #1 and #2.

## SECTION 6: DESCRIPTION OF THE CONSEQUENCE
- Identify all consequences that apply to the target context.  
- Rank order the 2 strongest consequences from those selected.  
- After identifying the strongest consequence(s) ask the follow-up question(s) that correspond with the letter of the item(s) rank ordered #1 and #2.

(Antecedent and Consequence lists + follow-up prompts are printed in the form; see template above.)

## SECTION 7: SETTING EVENT(S)
1. Identify all setting events in the list that apply.  
2. Rank order the strongest setting events from those selected.

SETTING EVENT(s): Rank order any events that happen outside of the immediate context (at home or earlier in the day) that commonly make problem behavior more likely or worse in the context described above.  
___ hunger ___lack of sleep ___illness ___missed medication ___conflict at home  
___conflict at school ___homework not done ___change in routine ___failure in previous class

## SECTION 8: SUMMARY STATEMENT
1. Write the top ranked responses and follow-up responses from the Antecedent, Consequence and Setting Event sections of the Adapted FACTS – Part B.  
2. Copy the information from the pathway found at the bottom of the Adapted FACTS – Part B into the following format:  
   During (Context = _______________) when (Antecedent = _______________) the student will (Problem Behavior = _______________) because (Consequence = _______________); therefore, the function of the behavior is to (obtain/avoid _______________). This is more likely to occur when (Setting = _______________).  
3. As a team, rate the level of confidence in the accuracy of the Summary Statement’s description of the relationship between the problem behavior and environmental events. A rating of 1, 2 or 3 indicates that the team does not have enough information to accurately identify antecedent and consequence events. A rating of 4, 5 or 6 indicates that the team is confident that the antecedent and consequence events have been accurately identified.

Pathway (as printed):  
**ANTECEDENT(s)/Triggers** → **PROBLEM BEHAVIOR(s)** → **CONSEQUENCE(s)/Function**  
When this happens . . . Student will . . . . Because this happens . . . Therefore the function is to obtain/avoid ___________________

# Record Review Guide

| Information Needed | Who Might Have Record | What to Look For | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Office Discipline Referrals (ODRs) | Data Entry Person, Assistant Principal | Types of problematic behaviors, times and locations in which they occurred, disciplinary penalty imposed, and increase/decrease in frequency/intensity of problem behavior | Helps to define problem behavior and identify patterns of events that precede problem behavior (antecedents), effective and ineffective disciplinary strategies, and possible maintaining consequences. Helps chart the progression of problem behavior. |
| Classroom Minors | Teacher, Data Entry Person, Assistant Principal | (not separately specified beyond ODR-style info in table layout) | (see above row’s “Why” content applies; table formatting groups early rows visually) |
| Absences | Attendance Secretary, Assistant Principal | Patterns and total number of absences | May give clues about antecedents for problem behavior and possible skill deficits from lack of opportunity to receive instruction. |
| Tardies | Attendance Secretary, Assistant Principal | Patterns and total number of tardies | May give clues about tasks/activities/subjects student may be attempting to avoid or interactions students may be attempting to obtain |
| G.P.A./Grades; Reading Assessment; Writing Assessment; Math Assessment | Teachers, Interventionists | Current grades and current and historical results of standardized testing | May indicate academic subjects and activities that are most difficult for the student (skill deficits) |
| Health Information (if applicable) | Nurse | Vision and hearing problems as well as other problems that may be related to school performance (e.g. motor difficulties, head traumas, long-term illnesses, current medication use) | Helpful for identifying conditions that may increase the likelihood of problem behavior or exacerbate existing problem behavior |
| IEP Information (if applicable) | Special Education | Instructional goals and objectives, how/if they are being taught, how/if they are being monitored, and other data supporting student performance | Provides information on the degree to which the behaviors of concern are being addressed in the classroom and if adjustments are made in response to review of data |
| Other: i.e. nurse or counselor visits | Nurse, counselor | Patterns of contacts and total number of contacts | May give clues about tasks/activities/subjects student may be attempting to avoid or interactions student may be attempting to obtain or avoid |

# Next Steps

Below are some next steps to consider as you develop your Tier 3 system. Some of the steps involve active staff input. Be sure to build your action plan with that in mind.

See **Tier 3 Action Planning - Establish a System of Support for Individual Students: Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA)**

1. Establish a system for collecting FBA information, including:
   - Collect Records Review data.
   - Conduct interviews with relevant stakeholders.
   - Prioritize problem behaviors as needed.
   - Conduct observations as needed.
2. Establish a system for developing a Summary Statement, including:
   - Create observable and measurable description of problem behavior.
   - Identify daily routines that are and are not associated with problem behavior.
   - Identify triggering antecedent events.
   - Identify maintaining consequence events.
   - Identify possible setting events.
   - Develop Summary Statement that includes antecedent, problem behavior, consequence, setting event (if applicable), and function of behavior as identified by the FBA.
3. Establish a system for confirming Summary Statement, including:
   - Conduct direct observations in routines that are and are not associated with problem behavior.
   - Confirm Summary Statement with data from observations.
