# Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA)

## Process

Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) is a process for identifying problem behaviors and developing interventions to improve or eliminate those behaviors.

An FBA consists of information-gathering procedures that result in a hypothesis about the function(s) that the behavior is serving for the student. The process also results in the identification of environmental antecedents (what happened before the behavior occurred) and consequences (what happened after the behavior occurred) that are maintaining the behavior. The information gathered is used to develop an effective and efficient behavior plan.

An FBA is generally understood to be an individualized evaluation of a child in accordance with 34 CFR §300.301 through §300.311 to assist in determining whether the child is, or continues to be a child with a disability. The FBA process is frequently used to determine the nature and extent of the special education and related services that the child needs, including the need for a positive behavior support plan.

As with other individualized evaluation procedures, and consistent with 34 CFR §300.300 (a) and (c), parental consent is required for an FBA to be conducted as part of the initial evaluation or a reevaluation.

Information must be gathered indirectly through a team interview of people who have observed the behavior of the student in a variety of settings and conditions. The purpose of the interview is to review variables affecting the behavior, and then narrow the focus to those variables that are important to the student.

Information also should be gathered by collecting data through direct observation of the behavior across settings and times with consideration of a variety of other environmental factors (e.g., other persons present, task demands, changing conditions). Information gathered during the interview portion of the FBA identifies the type of data to collect during direct observations. A graphic representation of the data collected, written descriptions collected through structured anecdotal reports during direct observations, and the interview information result in the following:

1. Development of a specific, clear description of the behavior of concern
2. Identification of environmental factors such as antecedents and consequences corresponding with the behavior
3. Development of summary statements identifying the perceived function(s) of the behavior of concern

## Data Based Decision Making

This information serves as the basis for the development of a positive behavior support plan that changes environmental conditions (i.e., antecedents and consequences) while providing instruction in the acquisition of new, more appropriate behaviors.

Throughout the baseline and intervention phases, data are collected and evaluated, and decisions are made based upon analyses of the data. Ongoing revisions to the positive behavior support plan should continue to be driven by data analyses.

# Regulatory Requirements

## When must a Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) be conducted?

An FBA must be conducted:

- ♦ Whenever the Individualized Education Program (IEP) team (1) determines that a student’s behavior is interfering with his/her learning or the learning of others, and (2) requires additional information to provide appropriate educational programming.
- ♦ When a behavior violates a “code of student conduct” that results in a change of placement and is determined by the IEP team to be a manifestation of the student’s disability.
- ♦ When the school refers the student to law enforcement.
- ♦ When a student is removed from his/her current placement as a result of weapon possession, and/or illegal drug possession/use, and/or serious bodily injury.

Positive, rather than negative, measures must form the basis of behavior support programs to ensure that all students and eligible young children shall be free from demeaning treatment, the use of aversive techniques, and the unreasonable use of restraints. Behavior support programs must include research-based practices and techniques to develop and maintain skills that will enhance an individual student’s or eligible young child’s opportunity for learning and self-fulfillment.

Behavior support programs and plans must be based on a functional assessment of behavior and utilize positive behavior techniques. When an intervention is needed to address problem behavior, the types of intervention chosen for a particular student or eligible young child shall be the least intrusive necessary. The use of restraints is considered a measure of last resort, only to be used after other less restrictive measures, including de-escalation techniques, in accord with Chapters 14 and 711.

Notwithstanding the requirements incorporated by reference in 34 CFR §300.34, §300.324 and §300.530 (relating to related services; development, review, and revision of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs); and authority of school personnel), with regard to a child’s behavior, the following words and terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:

- **Aversive techniques**—Deliberate activities designed to establish a negative association with a specific behavior.
- **Behavior support**—The development, change, and maintenance of selected behaviors through the systematic application of behavior change techniques.
- **Positive behavior support plans**—A plan for students with disabilities and eligible young children who require specific intervention to address behavior that interferes with learning. A positive behavior support plan shall be developed by the IEP team, be based on an FBA, and become part of the individual eligible young child’s or student’s IEP. These plans must include methods that utilize positive reinforcement and other positive techniques to shape a student’s or eligible young child’s behavior, ranging from the use of positive verbal statements as a reward for good behavior to specific tangible rewards.

When a change of placement occurs, and/or subsequent to a referral to law enforcement for students with disabilities, as part of the evaluation/reevaluation, the LEA must conduct an FBA. The LEA must then complete the report and develop a positive behavior support plan as part of the IEP or modify the existing positive behavior support plan to prevent recurrence of the behavior.

## Disciplinary change in placement

A disciplinary change in placement occurs when a student with a disability is removed for:

- ♦ More than 10 consecutive school days, or
- ♦ More than 15 cumulative school days in a school year, or
- ♦ When school days 11-15 constitute a pattern of exclusion, or
- ♦ Even one school day for a student with mental retardation
- ♦ Up to 45 school days to an interim alternative educational setting for violations involving drugs, weapons, or serious bodily injury.

# Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA): Steps to Conducting an FBA (Within the Context of the Evaluation or Reevaluation Process)

## STEP 1: Interview

The IEP team, including persons who have observed the behavior of the student in a variety of settings and conditions, completes the interview questions focusing on antecedents, behaviors, and consequences.

## STEP 2: Direct Observation

Data collection is accomplished through direct observation in the student’s natural environment. Direct observation provides objective data to support or refute the interview information; thus leading to more accurate hypothesis formation. The observation and the data collection methods are determined by information gathered during the interview phases.

## STEP 3: Summary

The IEP team summarizes the interview information and the data collected during direct observation to form one or more hypotheses identifying the function(s) the behavior is serving for the student. The IEP team uses this information to build a positive behavior support plan. Ongoing analyses of data collected during the intervention phase of the positive behavior support plan guide the team in measuring progress and making necessary revisions.

## Consequence Factors

1. Does the behavior allow the student to gain something?

   **A. Preferred activities or items?**  
   *Indicators:* The behavior often occurs when the student sometimes or always regains an item or activity that has been taken away or terminated. The behavior often occurs when the student sometimes or always gains access to an activity or item that the student was told he/she couldn’t have. The behavior rarely occurs when the student is given free access to his or her favorite items or activities.  
   o NO  o YES

   **B. Peer or adult attention?**  
   *Indicators:* The student frequently approaches others. The student frequently initiates social interaction. When the behavior occurs, someone usually responds by interacting with the student in some way (e.g., verbal reprimand, redirection, comforting statements). The behavior rarely occurs when the student is receiving attention.  
   o NO  o YES

2. Does the behavior allow the student to postpone, avoid, or escape something such as task demands, social interaction, etc.?  
   *Indicators:* The behavior often occurs when the student sometimes or always postpones or escapes the task demands placed upon him. The behavior rarely occurs when few demands are placed on the student or when the student is left alone. The student is often noncompliant when asked to complete tasks, and the student sometimes or always postpones or escapes the tasks. The behavior often occurs prior to predictable demands and the student sometimes or always avoids or postpones the tasks.  
   o NO  o YES

3. Does the behavior provide stimulation as an alternative to the student’s lack of active engagement in activities?  
   *Indicators:* The behavior occurs frequently when the student is alone or unoccupied. The student seems to have few known reinforcers or rarely engages in social interaction activities. When the student engages in the behavior, others usually respond by not attending to the behavior.  
   o NO  o YES

## STEP 2: Direct Observation

The FBA interview results in a measurable description of the behavior of concern and information that leads to direct observation with data collection and analysis.

### Direct observation:

- ♦ Serves to clearly define the behavior
- ♦ Supports or refutes interview information
- ♦ Allows for assessment of behavioral events in the student’s natural environment
- ♦ Leads to a hypothesis regarding the function(s) of the student’s behavior of concern
- ♦ Serves as a baseline to measure the frequency, duration, and/or intensity of the behavior prior to intervention
- ♦ Provides information that is necessary to build a positive behavior support plan
- ♦ Supplies the team with progress monitoring data to evaluate the implemented interventions and guide adjustments to the positive behavior support plan

### Data collection process:

- ♦ Define the behavior in observable and measurable terms
- ♦ Determine the purpose for data collection—the type of information needed from each data collection session (e.g. frequency counts, identifying antecedents and/or consequences)

### Data collection methods:

- ♦ Record frequency and/or duration indicating time of day, location, activities occurring, and people present
- ♦ Write a description of the student’s behavior as well as the antecedents and consequences using the Antecedent - Behavior - Consequence (A-B-C) format. This type of data must be collected multiple times across settings when the behavior of concern occurs as well as when the behavior of concern does not occur.

The following data collection tools, including sample forms are available on the PaTTAN website (www.pattan.net), go to Resources, Instructional Materials.

- ♦ Functional Assessment Observation Tools
- ♦ Functional Assessment Interview Forms
- ♦ Functional Assessment Secondary Team Forms
- ♦ Outline the schedule including where, when, how often, and who will collect data
- ♦ Design tools with clear coding systems that will result in the collection of the type of data needed and that are functional
- ♦ Transfer the data to a visual representation (graph) and analyze it for trend, level, and variability
- ♦ Analyze data regarding behavior of concern, antecedent events, and maintaining consequences to determine the function of behavior. Use this information to identify replacement behaviors and behavioral interventions, and develop a positive behavior support plan. An annotated positive behavior support plan and blank positive behavior support plan are available on the PaTTAN website (www.pattan.net).
- ♦ Utilize progress monitoring data to evaluate the implemented interventions and guide adjustments to the positive behavior support plan
