# Chapter 4: Milestones Scoring Instructions: Level 2

This chapter contains the specific instructions for administering Level 2 of the VB-MAPP Milestones Assessment. There are four new skills areas added to Level 2: Listener Responding by Function, Feature, and Class (LRFFC), Intraverbal, Classroom Routines and Group Skills, and Linguistic Structure. These areas were not included in Level 1 because most typically developing 18 month children have not acquired them yet. In addition, they should be avoided as part of the curriculum for a child with language delays whose scores fall primarily in Level 1. It is hoped that by presenting these skills in Level 2 it makes it clearer what skills to focus on for a child scoring in each of the levels. One skill area, Spontaneous Vocal Behavior, is not included in Level 2 because it is less of a target area for a child who has acquired echoic behavior. As a reminder, the four methods of assessing a specific skill are: 1) formal testing (T), 2) observation (O), 3) either observation or testing (E), and 4) a timed observation (TO).

## MAND – LEVEL 2

### Mands for 20 different missing items without prompts (except, e.g., *What do you need?*) (e.g., mands for paper when given a crayon). (E)

**MAND 6-M**

- **Objective:** To determine if a child mands for items when a part of a desired item is missing from a toy or desired activity.
- **Materials:** Gather items that are reinforcing for a child that have multiple parts, such as a Play Doh set. The removal of one part of a toy will create motivation (MOs) for that part, when the entire toy is presented.
- **Examples:** A child is playing with Play Doh and wants to make star shapes, but the star form has been removed. When asked, “What’s missing?” does the child ask for the missing star form? If the child likes juice and drinks it with a straw, give him a juice box without a straw and test if he mands for straw.
- **1 point score:** Give the child 1 point if he mands for 20 different missing items without prompts (other than verbal prompts such as, “What’s missing?” or “What do you need?”). It is important that the item that is missing be valuable to the child at that moment, (i.e., there must be a current MO at strength for the item).
- **½ point score:** Give the child ½ point if he mands for 10 different missing items without prompts.

# LEVEL 2: Interpreting the Level 2 Assessment: Curriculum Placement and Writing IEP Goals

If the target child is now spontaneously engaging in cooperative social play that involves imitation and echoic behavior, as well as manding and perhaps some tacting, there can be an increased focus on responding to peer mands, turn taking, sharing, and beginning intraverbal behavior. Also, aspects of creative and imaginative play can be introduced allowing the child to move beyond concrete play. The child’s increased ability to engage in social play with fewer adult prompts may indicate a readiness for “play dates” that may provide social interaction with peers in a looser and more natural environment. More complex social skills may still need to be established in a more structured environment.

## SOCIAL 8-M

Engages in sustained social play with peers for 3 minutes without adult prompts or reinforcement (e.g., cooperatively setting up a play set, water play).

## SOCIAL 9-M

Spontaneously responds to the mands from peers 5 times (e.g., *Pull me in the wagon. I want the train.*).

Once a child is manding to a peer and responding to the peer’s mands, other more complex verbal and nonverbal interactions may naturally develop. Much of what is called “friendship” involves the delivery of reinforcers (including attention) and the removal of aversives. Manding can do this. Once a peer becomes a conditioned reinforcer, imitating his behavior becomes fun for the child and new behaviors are learned this way. Wanting to be with other children can be a fragile process, and even many typically developing children have trouble with successful social interaction because of the many complicated variables involved (i.e., the complex verbal, nonverbal, and listener skills that form the basis of effective social interaction). If a child is successful at manding for reinforcers from peers, this increases the probability that the target child will “invite” the peer to join an activity, hang out with him, or cooperate in some other social game or interaction. Specific teaching procedures to prompt and reinforce a target child to include other children in activities can be valuable in starting this important social process.

## SOCIAL 10-M

Spontaneously mands to peers to participate in games, social play, etc., 2 times (e.g., *Come on you guys. Let's dig a hole.*).

This milestone represents a significant step for most children with autism or other developmental disabilities. It demonstrates that the necessary motivating variables for social interaction are operative, and are effective in evoking behaviors that can lead to further emotional and social development. Verbal behavior is an essential component of social behavior, and any opportunity to encourage children to verbally interact during social play should be taken. Once children are imitating and manding to each other, additional types of verbal interactions can be developed through social play. Narrating play activities is a type of tacting, but it may have mand and intraverbal elements as well; it is thus a complicated form of behavior that will only begin to emerge at this point, but should nevertheless be encouraged. For example, a child says, “I’m shooting webs from my hand like Spiderman” (a type of tact, but also a mand for attention). The second child may respond “Me too. Look out!” (an intraverbal and a mand). Thus, this forms the beginning of verbal exchanges on a single topic, and represents a very healthy type of social behavior. The more time that the target child spends in verbal and nonverbal interaction with peers, the higher the probability that social behavior will become more comfortable and productive for the child. A focus on cooperation to achieve a result, sharing responsibilities, turn taking, and verbal interactions using mands for information and intraverbal responses between children, will be an important component of the program at this point.

## Suggested IEP Goals for Social Behavior and Social Play: Level 2

*(select only 1 or 2 goals and modify them as appropriate for the individual child).*

- The child will spontaneously mand to peers at least 25 times per day.
- The child will spontaneously respond to the mands from peers 25 times in a single day.
- The child will engage in cooperative, constructive, or physical play activities with peers lasting at least 5 minutes.
- The child will spontaneously mand to peers using questions, directions, instructions, etc. (e.g., “What’s that?” “Where is your lunch?” “Come on, get your bike”) at least an average of 25 times per day.
- The child will take turns and share reinforcers with peers without prompts at least 5 times in a day.

# MOTOR IMITATION – LEVEL 2

## IMITATION 6-M

Imitates 10 actions that require selecting a specific object from an array (e.g., selects a drumstick from an array also containing a horn and a bell, and imitates an adult's drumming).

A child who scores at this level is learning to imitate the behavior of others, but this skill may be under the multiple control of adult verbal prompts such as “do this.” The formal teaching of imitation skills can have several valuable payoffs for a child. For example, imitation helps to teach a child to attend to the behavior of others (a major deficit for many children with autism), and can become a powerful vehicle for teaching new behaviors such as play, self-help, group responding, general compliance, and social skills. Imitation can also strengthen fine and gross motor skills, as well as promote physical fitness. The goal at this point is to encourage spontaneous imitation and imitation of others in the child’s natural play and social (group) contexts. In addition, adults should focus on increasing the number of different imitative behaviors, as well as teaching more complex imitation with objects (e.g., building a block house, tooth brushing, putting on a shoe), and functional imitation in the child’s day-to-day natural environment. Motor imitation along with vocal imitation (echoic) should be encouraged as well (e.g., pretending to be sleeping and snoring, pretending to be driving a car and saying “beep-beep”). A variety of additional activities for this level and the upcoming levels can be found in the VB-MAPP Imitation Task Analysis.

## IMITATION 7-M

Imitates 20 different fine motor actions when prompted, Do this (e.g., wiggling fingers, pinching, making a fist, making a butterfly).

The ability to imitate small motor movements will help set the stage for the development of a number of skills such as self-help, eating, drawing, writing, connecting things, assembling things, etc. Eventually, imitation begins to occur spontaneously and frequently, and as it does, it should become less of a formal target of the daily intervention program (as in intensive discrete trial training). For many children, acting like others becomes automatically reinforcing. In fact, the establishment of automatic reinforcement is one of the primary goals in developing both motor and vocal imitation. The reinforcers that maintain echoic and imitative behavior should gradually shift from contrived reinforcers to natural and automatic reinforcers, like in typical child development. Initially children may need to be taught to imitate others, but eventually children imitate others

# SELF-CARE CHECKLISTS

The focus of the VB-MAPP is primarily on communication and social skills. However, self-care skills are an important part of the child’s growing independence. The following self-care checklists can be used for assessment and skills tracking. The list can be downloaded and printed as needed to complete your child’s program. As always, the procedures derived from applied behavior analysis provide the best way to teach these skills.
