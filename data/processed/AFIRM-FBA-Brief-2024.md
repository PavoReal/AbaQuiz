# Functional Behavior Assessment

## What is FBA?

At times, all children and youth can struggle with challenging behavior. If a challenging behavior interferes with the learner’s ability to learn, then a functional behavior assessment (FBA) is needed. FBA can be used when the intensity, duration, or type of interfering behavior creates safety concerns or impacts a child’s development. An FBA assists the IEP team in understanding the function or purpose of a specific interfering behavior. Data collection is an essential component of FBA.

## Evidence-base

Based upon the 2020 systematic review conducted by the National Clearinghouse on Autism Evidence and Practice (NCAEP), this practice is an assessment practice that meets the evidence-based practice criteria with 21 single case design studies. This practice has been effective for early intervention (0-2 years), preschoolers (3-5 years), elementary school learners (6-11 years), middle school learners (12-14 years), high schoolers (15-18 years), and young adults (19-22 years) on the spectrum. Studies included the 2020 EBP report (Steinbrenner et al., 2020) detail how this practice can be used to effectively address the following outcomes for a target goal/behavior/skill: academic/pre-academic, adaptive/self-help, behavior, communication, and school readiness.

## How is FBA being used?

Functional Behavior Assessment can be used by a variety of professionals, including teachers, special educators, therapists, paraprofessionals, and early interventionists in educational and community-based environments. Parents and family members also can use Functional Behavior Assessment in the home.

# Evidence-base

The National Clearinghouse on Autism Evidence and Practice has adopted the following criteria to determine if a practice is evidence-based. The 2020 EBP report (Steinbrenner et al., 2020) provides more information about the systematic review process.

Efficacy must be established through high-quality, peer-reviewed research in scientific journals using:

- At least 2 randomized or quasi-experimental group design studies, or
- At least 5 single subject/case design studies, or a
- Combination of evidence of 1 randomized or quasi-experimental group design study and 3 single subject/case design studies

## Overview

Based upon the 2020 systematic review conducted by the National Clearinghouse on Autism Evidence and Practice (NCAEP), this practice is an assessment practice that meets the evidence-based practice criteria with 21 single case design studies. This practice has been effective for early intervention (0-2 years), preschoolers (3-5 years), elementary school learners (6-11 years), middle school learners (12-14 years), high schoolers (15-18 years), and young adults (19-22 years) on the spectrum. Studies included the 2020 EBP report (Steinbrenner et al., 2020) detail how this practice can be used to effectively address the following outcomes for a target goal/behavior/skill: academic/pre-academic, adaptive/self-help, behavior, cognitive, communication, and school readiness.

In the table below, the instructional outcomes identified by the evidence base are shown by age of participants.

| Age | Academic | Adaptive | Behavior | Cognitive | Communication | School-readiness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0-2 |  |  | Yes |  |  |  |
| 3-5 | Yes |  | Yes |  | Yes | Yes |
| 6-11 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 12-14 |  |  | Yes |  | Yes |  |
| 15-18 |  |  | Yes | Yes |  |  |
| 19-22 |  |  | Yes |  |  |  |

# Step-by-Step Guide

This step-by-step practice guide outlines how to plan for, use, and monitor Functional Behavior Assessment.

## Before you begin…

Each of the following points is important to address so that you can be sure Functional Behavior Assessment is likely to address the target goal/behavior/skill of your learner on the spectrum.

### Have you found out more information about…?

- ☐ Identifying the interfering behavior…?
- ☐ Collecting baseline data through direct observation…?
- ☐ Establishing a target goal or outcome that clearly states when the behavior will occur, what the target goal or outcome is, and how team members and/or observers will know when the skill is mastered…?

If the answer to any of the above questions is ‘No,’ review the process of how to select an appropriate EBP (https://afirm.fpg.unc.edu/selecting-EBP).

For more information about Functional Behavior Assessment, please visit https://afirm.fpg.unc.edu/.

Keep in mind that Functional Behavior Assessment can be used to decrease interfering behaviors and increase appropriate behaviors.

## Step 1: Planning for FBA

The planning step details the initial steps and considerations involved to prepare for using Functional Behavior Assessment with a learner on the spectrum.

### 1.1 Establish a multidisciplinary team

Planning should begin with forming a multidisciplinary team that includes all individuals who have observed the learner exhibiting the interfering behavior.

### 1.2 Identify and define interfering behavior

Together, the team identifies the interfering behavior that is most problematic for the learner. Any behaviors that create safety concerns for the learner or others should be addressed first.

### 1.3 Review records of learner

In order to understand the selected interfering behavior, records should be reviewed (medical records, psychological evaluations, educational testing, Individualized Education Program (IEP) or Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP), incident reports, anecdotal notes, etc.)

### 1.4 Select assessment procedures

Team members will gather information concerning the behavior from formal/informal interviews and standardized behavior rating scales.

The FBA ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES can be used to select an assessment tool to observe the learner.

### 1.5 Develop plan for collecting data

Data will need to be collected during times and settings where the interfering behavior occurs most often. Also, it is important to sample in other locations or at other times where the behavior might not occur. Data collection should be for a sufficient period of time to identify consistencies in the behavior.

The FBA PLANNING SHEET can be used as a companion for completing the planning step.

## Step 2: Using FBA

This step details the process of implementing Functional Behavior Assessment with a learner on the spectrum.

### 2.1 Collect data using selected assessment procedures

During the planning stage, the team selected several assessment tools and/or interviews. These will need to be administered, and data collected.

The REINFORCER SAMPLING can be used to determine activities and/or materials that will motivate the learner.

### 2.2 Collect data on the occurrence of interfering behavior

Following the developed plan, the team collects data on the interfering behavior using direct observation methods. Using A-B-C data charts will help team members determine what happens right before the behavior (the antecedent), when the behavior that occurs (behavior), and what happens directly after the behavior (the consequence). Also, data tables (commonly referred to as scatterplots in the FBA literature) can be used for data collection in order to help team members determine when the behavior is occurring, the possible functions of the behavior, and times of the day when an intervention might be implemented to reduce the interfering behavior.

The ABC DATA COLLECTION can be used to understand the antecedent behavior and consequence.  
The DATA COLLECTION: SCATTERPLOT form can be used to identify patterns.

### 2.3 Analyze collected data

Analyze collected data to determine the function of the behavior. Behaviors typically fall into two categories of function: 1) to get or obtain something desired or 2) to escape or avoid.

### 2.4 Develop a hypothesis statement

Based upon the information gathered through assessments, interviews, and direct observations, the team develops a hypothesis statement. Be sure the hypothesis statement developed includes:

1) the setting events, immediate antecedents, and immediate consequences that surround the interfering behavior,  
2) a restatement and refinement of the description of the interfering behavior that is occurring, and  
3) the function the behavior serves (i.e., get/obtain, escape/avoid).

The FBA HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT WORKSHEET can be used to develop a hypothesis statement.

### 2.5 Test the hypothesis to ensure it is correct

To test the developed hypothesis, modify the setting/activity to increase the probability that the behavior occurs. Testing can occur over several days or weeks to confirm the cause of the interfering behavior.

### 2.6 Identify appropriate EBPs to address the interfering behavior

When team members understand the function of the behavior, evidence-based practices can be implemented to reduce the occurrence of the identified interfering behavior while increasing appropriate behaviors.

The ADDITIONAL EBPS CHART can be used to determine which evidence-based practice(s) to use with the learner.

### 2.7 Develop behavior intervention plan

After an EBP is identified, the team develops a behavior intervention plan. The BIP should include strategies for the following: 1) preventing the occurrence of the interfering behavior, 2) teaching or increasing the replacement behavior, and 3) increasing learning opportunities and social engagement.

The BEHAVIOR INTERVENTION PLAN can be used to develop the BIP.

## Step 3: Monitoring FBA

The following step details how to monitor the use of Functional Behavior Assessment with a learner on the spectrum and how to determine next steps based on the data.

### 3.1 Collect and analyze data

Team members need to collect data that focus on 1) the frequency, or how often, the behavior occurs using time sampling or event sampling, 2) how long (duration) the interfering behavior lasts when it occurs, and 3) frequency of use of replacement behavior(s) including how often the leaner uses the replaced behavior(s).

The EVENT SAMPLING FORM can be used to monitor the frequency the identified interfering behavior occurring.  
The DURATION (BAR CHART) FORM can be used to monitor how long the identified interfering behavior occurs.  
The DURATION (TIME) FORM can be used to monitor how long the identified interfering behavior occurs.  
The REPLACEMENT BEHAVIOR FORM can monitor strategies and interventions.

### 3.2 Determine next steps based on learner progress

Collecting data will help team members determine if a learner is making progress and reducing the use of the identified interfering behavior. If a learner is making progress based upon data collected, team members should continue to use the selected strategies.

If team members determine that the learner is not making progress, consider the following:

- Is the behavior well defined?
- Is the behavior measurable and observable?
- Are the selected evidence-based practices used with fidelity based upon the implementation checklists?
- Are all team members and staff members consistently using the identified strategies and responses to behavior?

If these issues have been addressed and the learner with autism continues not to show progress, consider selecting a different evidence-based practice to use with the learner with on the spectrum.
