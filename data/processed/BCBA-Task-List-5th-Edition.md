## Introduction

The BCBA Task List includes the knowledge and skills that serve as the foundation for the BCBA examination.

## Structure

The BCBA Task List is organized in two major sections, **Foundations**, which includes basic skills and underlying principles and knowledge, and **Applications**, which includes more practice-oriented skills.

### Section 1: Foundations

A. Philosophical Underpinnings  
B. Concepts and Principles  
C. Measurement, Data Display, and Interpretation  
D. Experimental Design

### Section 2: Applications

E. Ethics (Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts)  
F. Behavior Assessment  
G. Behavior-Change Procedures  
H. Selecting and Implementing Interventions  
I. Personnel Supervision and Management

# Section 1: Foundations

- **B-9** Define and provide examples of operant extinction.
- **B-10** Define and provide examples of stimulus control.
- **B-11** Define and provide examples of discrimination, generalization, and maintenance.
- **B-12** Define and provide examples of motivating operations.
- **B-13** Define and provide examples of rule-governed and contingency-shaped behavior.
- **B-14** Define and provide examples of the verbal operants.
- **B-15** Define and provide examples of derived stimulus relations.

## C. Measurement, Data Display, and Interpretation

- **C-1** Establish operational definitions of behavior.
- **C-2** Distinguish among direct, indirect, and product measures of behavior.
- **C-3** Measure occurrence (e.g., count, frequency, rate, percentage).
- **C-4** Measure temporal dimensions of behavior (e.g., duration, latency, interresponse time).
- **C-5** Measure form and strength of behavior (e.g., topography, magnitude).
- **C-6** Measure trials to criterion.
- **C-7** Design and implement sampling procedures (i.e., interval recording, time sampling).
- **C-8** Evaluate the validity and reliability of measurement procedures.
- **C-9** Select a measurement system to obtain representative data given the dimensions of behavior and the logistics of observing and recording.
- **C-10** Graph data to communicate relevant quantitative relations (e.g., equal-interval graphs, bar graphs, cumulative records).
- **C-11** Interpret graphed data.

## D. Experimental Design

- **D-1** Distinguish between dependent and independent variables.
- **D-2** Distinguish between internal and external validity.
- **D-3** Identify the defining features of single-subject experimental designs (e.g., individuals serve as their own controls, repeated measures, prediction, verification, replication).
- **D-4** Describe the advantages of single-subject experimental designs compared to group designs.
- **D-5** Use single-subject experimental designs (e.g., reversal, multiple baseline, multielement, changing criterion).
- **D-6** Describe rationales for conducting comparative, component, and parametric analyses.
