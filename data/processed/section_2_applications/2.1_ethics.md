# Overview

The Authorized Continuing Education (ACE) program exists to make a wide array of continuing education (CE) events available to Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) certificants. ACE Providers have been authorized by the BACB to provide Learning Continuing Education (CE) to BCBA and BCaBA certificants.

This handbook describes the requirements for obtaining and maintaining status as an ACE Provider. The BACB does not review or approve individual events offered by ACE Providers; it is the ACE Provider's responsibility to ensure that all CE events meet the requirements described in this handbook. Noncompliance with these requirements may result in the suspension or revocation of ACE Provider status.

> **Note:** Authorization as an ACE Provider does not imply endorsement or approval of the CEU content by the BACB. ACE Providers must avoid using language that suggests the BACB has accredited, approved, or endorsed a specific ACE event.

# Continuing Education Requirements

## Purpose of CE

Initial BCBA and BCaBA certification indicates that an individual has met entry-level standards for practice as a behavior analyst. The purpose of the BACB's CE requirement is to ensure that certificants continue to engage in activities that expand their behavior-analytic skills beyond the requirements for initial certification and help them stay up to date on developments in the profession.

## CE Content Requirements

The content of Learning CE events may address any aspect of behavior analysis: practice, science, methodology, theory, or the profession itself. In addition, Learning CE content must cover material that goes beyond the current BCBA Task List and BCaBA Task List, be behavior-analytic in nature, be designed for attendees with a behavior-analytic background, and reflect current and accurate content.

> **Note:** While not mandatory, the BACB strongly encourages including learning objectives for all events. Learning objectives should be behaviorally written, identify new skills beyond those required to become certified, and be feasible to accomplish.

### Beyond the Current Task List

Learning CE events must cover material that goes beyond the current BCBA Task List and BCaBA Task List and coursework required to sit for the certification exams. However, the event may include a brief review of task list material during the introductory portion. For example, an event may include a review of the typical functions of behavior before covering new research on functional analysis. Events that merely repackage basic behavior-analytic techniques are not acceptable for Learning CE.

### Behavior-Analytic in Nature

The majority of a Learning CE event must cover content that is behavior-analytic in nature. For example, an event covering the characteristics and diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is not appropriate for Learning CE. However, an event covering techniques for safely conducting functional assessments of stereotypic behavior is appropriate.

### Audience

The Learning CE event should be designed for professional behavior analysts who have already had bachelor's level (BCaBA) or master's level (BCBA) coursework in behavior analysis. Events designed for other audiences, such as parents or professionals from other disciplines, should not be offered for Learning CE.

### Up-to-Date Content

ACE Providers should make every effort to ensure that the content of all CE events is accurate and up-to-date (e.g., it represents best available scientific evidence; is focused on current best practices in behavior analysis; is consistent with current local laws, regulations, policies, and ethical standards).

# Ethics CE

This category is defined as (a) events related to the BACB's ethics requirements and/or (b) events related to cultural/contextual responsiveness. The content must relate to behavior-analytic practice or applied research and be directly linked to the behavior-analytic literature and/or established practice. To qualify as Ethics continuing education, most of the event must focus on ethics or cultural/contextual responsiveness. Continuing education events that only briefly reference the BACB's ethics codes and primarily cover unrelated content should not be offered as Ethics continuing education.

## Examples of Appropriate Ethics Requirements Content

- Considerations for implementing nonbehavioral therapies
- Addressing ethics violations with others
- Strategies for remaining compliant with requirements (e.g., billing, supervision, licensure, and certification requirements)
- Techniques for avoiding or managing dual relationships
- Ethical implications of media and technology

## Examples of Appropriate Cultural/Contextual Responsiveness Content

- Navigating situations where your cultural values differ from those of your client
- Choosing assessment tools that are validated and appropriate for the client's contextual circumstances
- Engaging in collaborative goal setting
- Working with caregivers to identify goals that align with their cultural priorities
- Delivering feedback in a manner consistent with cultural norms

## Nonexamples of Ethics Requirements or Cultural/Contextual Responsiveness Content

- Communicating one's perspective or lived experience without relating the majority of the event to behavior-analytic practice or applied research
- Addressing political or societal events without relating the majority of the event to behavior-analytic practice or applied research

---

# Supervision CE

## 8-hour Supervision Training

Certificants who wish to supervise individuals pursuing BACB certification or the ongoing practice of BCaBAs or RBTs are required to obtain specific training in supervision based on the BACB's Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline (2.0). This training may be completed up to 180 days prior to the date the certificant becomes certified. This training must be delivered by an ACE Provider (or embedded in a VCS program).

## Ongoing Supervision CE

Supervisors are required to obtain 3 CEUs on supervision in every recertification cycle. Acceptable supervision content must be behavior-analytic in nature and cover effective supervision as described in the Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline (2.0).

---

# Teaching CE

Teaching CE includes instruction of a Learning CE event, on a one-time basis for each event, for the duration of time the instructor was presenting the event. Teaching CE is intended to ensure that the certificant is continuing to engage in activities that will expand their behavior-analytic skills, which includes research, preparation for, and delivery of instruction.

## Examples of Teaching CE

- A 25-minute presentation within a two-hour symposium could be submitted for 0.5 Teaching CEUs.
- Presentation of a two-hour workshop could qualify as 2 Teaching CEUs.
- Preparing for, and actively participating in, a one-hour panel could qualify as 1 Teaching CEU.

# CE Event Requirements

## Event Instructor

Every Learning CE event must have an instructor who meets the requirements outlined in the ACE Provider Roles and Responsibilities section of this handbook.

> Refer to the "Learning CE Event Checklist" to make sure your event meets the Learning requirements.

## Event Duration

Each event must include a minimum of 25 minutes of instruction, for which 0.5 CEUs are awarded. Additional CEUs should be awarded in increments of 0.5 (25 minutes of instruction) or 1.0 (50 minutes of instruction). For example:
- 50 minutes = 1 CEU
- 75 minutes = 1.5 CEUs
- 100 minutes = 2 CEUs

Rounding up is not permitted when issuing CEUs.

## Monitoring Participation

Providers are responsible for ensuring that participants are present for the entire event and maintaining documentation of participants' attendance.

> There are many ways to ensure participants remain for the entirety of an event. For instance, have participants sign in and out, embed active student responding questions, or include verification codes to access additional material.

## Event Format

The event format may vary as long as all of the requirements outlined in this handbook are met. Both live and online (synchronous and asynchronous) events are permitted. For instance, providers may offer Learning CE for:
- Conference presentations (e.g., paper presentations, symposia, panel discussions, invited addresses)
- Workshops
- Tutorials
- Online courses or other distance education activities
- Activities such as reading a journal article and discussing it in a facilitated journal club meeting

## Event Feedback

Providers must offer all participants the opportunity to provide written evaluative feedback about the event.

## Event Fees

ACE Providers may establish their own fees for CE events. The BACB does not establish fees, nor does it recoup fees (i.e., no kickbacks). CE events may be offered free of charge and may also be offered in-house only.

---

# CE Event Documentation

## Documentation for Learning Participants

Documentation of Learning CE must be issued to the participant within 45 days of the event and must include the following information:

- Participant's name and BACB certification number
- ACE Provider's name and provider number
- ACE Coordinator's name, if an Organization Provider
- Title of the event (note: multi-presentation conference events must include the title of each session attended by the certificant)
- Instructor's name
- Event date(s)
- Event modality (i.e., in-person, online synchronous, online asynchronous)
- Number of Learning CEUs
- Number of CEUs applicable to the ethics and supervision categories

The format of CE documentation is flexible. Examples of acceptable documentation include, but are not limited to:
- A formal certificate
- A letter of verification
- Completion of the template included with this handbook (see the Learning Certificate Template - Individual ACE Providers and the Learning Certificate Template - Organization ACE Providers)

Participants are responsible for entering information from each event into their BACB account.

## Documentation for Teaching Instructors

ACE Providers must also provide a letter for instructors who request it for Teaching CE purposes. This letter should contain the same information required in certificates of completion, above, with the event instructor's name and certification number. See the Teaching Letter Template.

## Documentation for the BACB

In addition to the information listed above, ACE Providers must maintain records demonstrating that they are meeting the requirements outlined in this handbook, which may include a combination of the following:

- A summary of all events offered
- Event syllabi and/or presentation materials
- Evidence of instructor qualifications
- Copies of attendance records
- Description of event monitoring procedures
- Copy of certificates awarded to attendees
- Event feedback
- Marketing materials

These records must be maintained for a period of five years from the date of the event. ACE Providers must make these records available to the BACB upon request.

> **Note:** Failure to provide documentation that these requirements were met may result in the BACB not accepting CEUs from the relevant event(s).

# ACE Provider Roles and Responsibilities

## ACE Provider Types

There are two types of ACE Providers: Individual Providers and Organization Providers. 

**Individual Providers** must deliver the instruction themselves and be present during the entire CE event, although a co-presenter may assist them. 

**Organization Providers** must designate an individual to serve as the organization's ACE Coordinator (described below). ACE Coordinators are not required to be present during CE events offered by their organization; however, they retain responsibility for the events provided by that organization.

## ACE Coordinators and Individual Providers

### Qualifications

ACE Coordinators and Individual Providers must meet the following criteria:

- ACE Coordinators and Individual Providers must be actively certified and in good standing as a BCBA for at least 5 years; AND
- They must be willing and able to fulfill all responsibilities described herein for the entire duration of the authorization period (one year).

> **Current ACE Coordinators on Initial ACE Applications or Coordinator Change:** Current ACE Coordinators can remain in their positions, even if they have not been certified for 5 years, as long as they continue to renew on time.

# Responsibilities

ACE Coordinators and Individual Providers must:

- Follow the requirements stated in this handbook
- Ensure that instructors/co-presenters and CE event content meet the requirements in this handbook
- Ensure that procedures are in place and followed for disclosing affiliations with companies, products, and/or services that may be featured during a CE event. These disclosures must be made to participants prior to their registration for the event.
- Monitor their intellectual property to ensure it is not being misused (e.g., forged certificates)
- Provide replacement certificates to participants when requested
- Resolve all complaints from participants
- Ensure that all duties are carried out in compliance with the standards described in this handbook if delegating any administrative duties
- Serve as the single point of contact between the ACE Provider and the BACB for all communication
- Ensure the information listed in the ACE Provider Verification Registry is accurate
- Advise the incoming ACE Coordinator or organization how to notify the BACB of the change (see the ACE Coordinator Changes section) and transfer all CE event documentation (see the CE Event Documentation section) to the incoming ACE Coordinator
- Complete annual renewal requirements and pay renewal fees on time to maintain ACE Provider status
- Stay current on any changes to ACE Provider requirements, logos, and any updates to this handbook

# Qualified ACE Instructor Requirements

Qualified ACE Instructors may deliver instruction at CE events for Organization Providers. Qualified ACE Instructors must work under the supervision of the organization's ACE Coordinator and must meet one of the following qualifications:

- Hold active BCBA certification
- Have a doctorate and substantial, formal training in behavior analysis
- Be a current graduate student who has completed a master's degree and is enrolled in a behavior-analytic doctoral program

## Co-Presenter

An individual who does not meet one of the Qualified ACE Instructor requirements may serve as a co-presenter under the direct, in-person supervision of a Qualified ACE Instructor or an Individual Provider.

All Qualified ACE Instructors, co-presenters, and Individual Providers must have substantial expertise in the subject matter being presented and follow the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts (Code) during the event.

### Example of ACE Roles in a Symposium

Learning CE could be offered for symposia in which only the discussant is a Qualified ACE Instructor, as long as they review the co-presenters' materials in advance. Additionally, Learning CE could be offered for symposia chaired by university faculty who meet the Qualified ACE Instructor requirements, with the faculty member's graduate students presenting all instruction, provided those students have substantial expertise in the subject matter being presented.

   - Mailing a check to: Behavior Analyst Certification Board, 7950 Shaffer Parkway, Littleton, CO 80127 USA (please include the ACE Provider name on the check).

4. Wait up to two weeks from the date your complete application (including payment) is received for your application to be processed.

5. After your application is reviewed, you will receive either an approval email with your provider number or an email informing you of what is needed to continue processing your application.

## Annual Renewal

Annual renewals are required to maintain ACE Provider status and may be completed up to 45 days prior to the ACE Provider's renewal date.

### Instructions

1. Read the ACE Provider Handbook and contact the BACB with any questions via the Contact Us Form.

2. Complete the ACE Provider Renewal Application (for Individual Providers or Organization Providers) and submit it via the Contact Us Form.

5. After your application is reviewed, you will receive either an approval email or an email informing you of what is needed to continue processing your application.

# Expiration

ACE Provider status will expire for any provider who does not submit a completed renewal application (including payment) by their renewal date. There is a 30-day reinstatement period for ACE Providers who do not renew on time. If all renewal information and payment (including an additional $50 late fee) are submitted during this period, then ACE Provider status may be restored. Payment of the late fee may be submitted as described in step 3 above. Learning CE events may not be offered during the reinstatement period and ACE Providers will not be listed on the ACE Provider Verification Registry during this time. Please note, continued provision of Learning CE following expiration could constitute a violation of the BACB's ethics requirements.

If an ACE Provider does not complete a renewal within the allowable time period, they will need to apply for ACE Provider status again by completing a new initial application (including paying the initial application fee). If approved, a new ACE Provider number will be issued. Learning CE events may not be offered while expired, and an ACE status may not be retroactively applied. If ACE status is believed to have been expired in error, the BACB appeals policies may be reviewed.

# Fees

## Application Fee

| Application | Fee |
| --- | --- |
| ACE Initial Application (Individuals) | $100 |
| ACE Initial Application (Organizations) | $200 |

## ACE Coordinator Changes (Organization Providers)

Organization Providers who would like to change the ACE Coordinator on record with the BACB must complete the ACE Coordinator Change Application and submit it via the Contact Us Form in advance of the change. Once approved, the previous ACE Coordinator must transfer all documentation to the new ACE Coordinator.

# ACE Audits

The BACB makes maintenance and disciplinary decisions based on information provided by ACE Providers; therefore, the BACB reserves the right to audit ACE Providers at any time. The BACB may request documentation, such as attendee records or event materials, to verify that all of the requirements in this handbook have been met.

Before or during an audit, if inconsistencies are found between documentation submitted by the certificant and the ACE Coordinator, or if the ACE Coordinator has provided inconsistent responses, the ACE Coordinator may be required to sign a Continuing Education Affidavit.

# Complaint Process

All complaints from participants in Learning CE events, including those regarding potential BACB CE event requirements violations must first be directed to the Individual Provider/ACE Coordinator in writing. If a complaint cannot be resolved with the provider, the participant may file a formal complaint by submitting a Notice of Alleged Violation directly with the BACB.

# Disciplinary Action

If the provider fails to respond in a timely fashion, was noncompliant with an audit request, or if the evidence does not adequately refute the allegations in the Notice of Alleged Violation, the BACB may sanction the provider's approval status. Potential sanctions include, but are not limited to: suspending the provider's status until the complaint has been resolved; requiring the provider to revise their CE events, procedures, and/or instructors; or revoking the provider's status as an ACE Provider.

All ACE Coordinators and Individual ACE Providers must be in good standing with the BACB. ACE Coordinators and Providers who are subject to specific consequences outlined in a Disciplinary Determination are responsible for taking action to minimize disruption to provision of ACE events. If an ACE Coordinator's certification is revoked, suspended, or inactivated they must transition their duties within 30 days of receiving their disciplinary determination. If an Individual ACE Provider's certification is revoked, suspended, or inactivated they must submit a request to the ACE Provider Contact Form (select Other) informing the BACB that due to disciplinary sanctions their Individual ACE Provider status needs to be placed on inactive.

# Overview

## About the Behavior Analyst Certification Board

The Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc.® (BACB®) has been the leader in behavior analyst certification for over two decades. The BACB is a nonprofit corporation that was established in 1998 to meet professional certification needs identified by behavior analysts, governments, and consumers of behavior-analytic services. The BACB's mission is to protect consumers of behavior-analytic services by systematically establishing, promoting, and disseminating professional standards of practice.

In the profession of applied behavior analysis, the BACB's primary role is to operate certification programs, which involves responsibilities similar to regulatory boards. In this role, the BACB establishes practice standards, administers examinations, and provides ethics requirements and a disciplinary system for each of its certification programs. To learn more about our role and limitations, read our blog post, *The BACB: What it is, What it Does, and Why*, and listen to Episode 11 of our podcast, *Inside the BACB*.

## Jurisdiction

The BACB currently accepts certification applications from individuals who reside in the following countries:

| Country | Upcoming Changes |
|---------|------------------|
| United States (US) | None |
| Canada | Ontario residents can no longer apply for RBT or BCaBA certification. Those holding RBT and BCaBA certification in Ontario have had their certification placed on voluntary inactive status. RBTs and BCaBAs who relocate to Ontario should contact the BACB to be placed on voluntary inactive status. Ontario residents will no longer be able to apply for BCBA/BCBA-D certification as of June 30, 2026. Those holding BCBA/BCBA-D certification in Ontario will be able to maintain their certification. |
| Australia | Residents of Australia will no longer be able to apply for BACB certification as of January 1, 2027. Those holding BACB certifications in Australia will be able to maintain their certification. |

Existing certificants may maintain certification and reside in any country.

## What Is a Board Certified Behavior Analyst?

The Board Certified Behavior Analyst® (BCBA®) is a graduate-level certification in behavior analysis. Professionals certified at the BCBA level are independent practitioners who provide behavior-analytic services.

BCBA certificants may supervise the work of Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst® (BCaBA®) certificants, Registered Behavior Technician® (RBT®) certificants, and other professionals who implement behavior-analytic services. They may also function in the role of a BCaBA or RBT. Certificants may hold only one BACB certification at a time. When a certificant obtains a higher-level certification, their lower-level certification will expire after 180 days.

If the lower-level certification expires during this 180-day period and the certificant wishes to renew or recertify while they are waiting for their new certification to be recognized by relevant stakeholders, they may submit a renewal or recertification application to maintain their lower-level certification throughout the 180-day period.

**Note:** In the interest of consumer protection and to ensure that the BACB certification mark is only used to accurately represent certification status, the BACB may seek legal and other remedies to address any misrepresentation of BACB certification (and/or any misuse of other BACB trademarks and logos) that constitutes trademark infringement. For more information about the use of BACB certification marks, see the September 2008, October 2013, and July 2021 BACB Newsletters.

## Board Certified Behavior Analyst—Doctoral

BCBAs with doctoral training in behavior analysis may receive the designation of Board Certified Behavior Analyst-Doctoral® (BCBA-D®). The BCBA-D is not a separate certification, and it does not grant any privileges above or beyond BCBA certification. BCBA-Ds function in the same capacity as BCBAs (i.e., as independent practitioners who provide behavior-analytic services) and are required to meet all BCBA maintenance requirements.

# Overview of Becoming and Maintaining BCBA Certification

## Important Notice: Australia

Residents of Australia will no longer be able to apply for BACB certification as of January 1, 2027. Those holding BACB certifications in Australia will be able to maintain their certification.

## Certification Pathway Overview

```
MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS → APPLY → TAKE & PASS BCBA EXAM → MAINTAIN CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS → ADHERE TO ETHICS REQUIREMENTS → RECERTIFY EVERY TWO YEARS
```

### Available Pathways

1. **Pathway 1:** ABAI- or APBA-Accredited Degree
2. **Pathway 2:** Behavior-Analytic Coursework
3. **Pathway 3:** Faculty Teaching and Research
4. **Pathway 4:** Postdoctoral Experience

---

## Reasons for Becoming a BCBA

There are many benefits to obtaining BCBA certification, including:

- **Leading credential:** BCBA certification is the leading behavior analyst credential and is required by many funders and licensure boards. BCBA certification is offered by the first certifying entity in behavior analysis, the BACB, which has been certifying behavior analysts for over 20 years.

- **Demonstrates competency:** BCBA certification shows that you have met certain requirements that are critical in providing and overseeing behavior-analytic services.

- **Consumer protection:** BCBA certification provides increased consumer protection since you must meet certain eligibility and maintenance requirements to obtain and maintain certification.

- **Verification of credentials:** BCBA certification makes it easier for employers, funders, and consumers, among others, to verify that you have certain knowledge, skills, and abilities and are not under disciplinary sanctions.

---

## Accreditation

The BCBA, BCaBA, and RBT certification programs are accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the accreditation body of the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE). NCCA's Standards for the Accreditation of Certification Programs were the first standards developed for professional certification programs to help ensure the health, welfare, and safety of the public. NCCA standards articulate the essential elements of a high-quality certification program. Consistent with these standards, the BACB's certification requirements, examination content, and procedures undergo regular review by subject matter experts in the discipline. To learn more about accreditation, see ICE's video, Value of Accreditation: Why It Matters.

## You Want to Pursue Certification… Now What?

So, you are interested in pursuing BCBA certification. What should you do now? Although the BACB cannot instruct you on how to meet our requirements, the content in this section is intended to provide some guidance that might be helpful as you start this journey.

### A Few Tips Before Getting Started

First, carefully review both the eligibility and maintenance requirements that are detailed in this handbook.

Second, determine which eligibility pathway you plan to pursue. The majority of BCBA certificants apply under pathway 1 or pathway 2, so this section focuses primarily on those pathways. Once you have selected a pathway, determine when you might apply, as it may take a few years to meet all of the requirements, and the eligibility requirements may change.

Third, you will want to create a BACB account using these tips:

- Enter your full legal name exactly as it appears on your government-issued identification. If it does not match exactly, you will not be able to take the examination. Name changes require review by BACB staff, so a name change could delay your ability to take the examination.

- Use a personal email address and not a work or school email address. Important notifications and reminders are sent to this address, so if you change employers or lose access to your school email address, you will not receive reminders, correspondence, or password resets.

- Set up the profile yourself and do not share your account information with anyone else, including your employer. This is your certification—no one else should be managing it for you. The contact information you provide must include your current address and phone number. It is very important that you list your current address, as your residence must be under the BACB's jurisdiction.

- Update your information in your BACB account as soon as changes occur (e.g., name change, address change, email address change).

- Do not create more than one account. If you are having trouble getting into your account, please use the Contact Us Form for assistance.

Creating a BACB account will give you a BACB ID, which you will need to add to documents as you work toward certification. Having a BACB account also means that you will receive important updates from the BACB.

### Considerations When Exploring Training Options

You only receive your initial training once. If possible, don't pick your training out of convenience, expense, or geography. We recommend thoroughly researching the trainings before committing to one. While we can't provide guidance on where to receive your behavior-analytic coursework, here are some things to consider.

Ideally, you should obtain your education in behavior analysis from a behavior-analytic degree program. There are many benefits to this option. For instance, in most cases, you can meet all BCBA eligibility requirements in one place while also having engaging, non-classroom interactions with behavior-analytic faculty and students that will greatly enhance your education and begin to develop your behavior-analytic social networks. Even if you don't receive all of your supervised fieldwork through the degree-granting program, your faculty will likely help you identify where you can accrue your hours in an immersive behavior-analytic environment. If completing your education in a behavior-analytic degree program is a possibility for you, here are a few things to consider as you research programs.

# Overview

You may obtain your behavior-analytic coursework in one of the following ways:

## Pathway 1: APBA-Accredited or ABAI-Accredited or Recognized Behavior Analysis Degree Program

Master's degree (or higher) behavior analysis programs that have been accredited by APBA or accredited or recognized by ABAI (under ABAI Tiers 1, 2a, or 2b) have met quality standards for their curriculum, faculty, and supports, among others. If you receive a master's degree or higher from one of these programs, both the coursework and degree eligibility requirements will be met. Accredited or recognized programs may be found on the APBA and ABAI websites.

## Pathway 2: Behavior-Analytic Coursework

The other option is to complete behavior-analytic coursework at a university that offers coursework meeting the Pathway 2 coursework requirements and has a qualifying Pathway 2 Program Contact.

## Considerations When Selecting Your Program

When determining where to obtain your coursework, consider the following:

### Program Focus
- Do you have any existing areas of interest? If so, does the program align with your professional goals?
- Is the program led by faculty with similar interests?
- Will the program help facilitate experience in areas that are meaningful to you?

### Program Size
- Find out the size of each cohort and determine if the size is a good fit for you as a learner
- This information can usually be found on the program's website
- University pass rate documents also give an idea of program size by looking at the number of candidates who took the examination from an institution each year (see the Sort by Volume section)

### Program Structure
- Courses are usually taught on campus, online, or in a combination of online and on-campus experiences
- Consider what structure is the best fit for you as a learner
- Reflect on what has worked for you in the past: Were you successful in online courses? Did you need or value in-person experiences? In what setting did you learn the most and feel the most engaged?

### Number of Faculty
- Determine how many part- and full-time faculty are on staff, especially in relation to the program size
- Understand the student-to-faculty ratio

### University Pass Rates
- The BACB annually publishes examination pass rate data for universities with Pathway 2 behavior-analytic coursework programs and ABAI-accredited programs
- Passing the BCBA examination is not the most important part of your training, but, at a minimum, your training should prepare you to pass the examination

## Getting Started

Once you have identified where you will get your behavior-analytic coursework, your faculty mentor/advisor, program chair, and/or Pathway 2 Program Contact will be your resource(s) to help you meet the BACB's requirements along the way.

# Considerations When Identifying Practical Fieldwork Opportunities

Remember that qualifying behavior-analytic coursework needs to begin before fieldwork, so make sure you get your coursework situation figured out beforehand. 

Once you have started your coursework, determine where you want to accrue your structured fieldwork hours and whether it will give you the applied experience that will prepare you to practice independently after you are certified. For instance, consider the population(s) and setting(s) where you want to ultimately provide behavior-analytic services. 

The BACB cannot provide this guidance, so you should reach out to your Pathway 2 Program Contact, advisor, or employer for guidance about where to accrue fieldwork in your chosen area.

# Overview

When identifying supervisor(s) to oversee your fieldwork hours, ensure that they are qualified to be your supervisor (see the Fieldwork Requirements section). In addition, you should focus on finding supervisors who have a successful track record of BACB supervision. You could do this in a number of ways, but here are a few ideas:

- Check on their certification status in the Certificant Registry to ensure that they are qualified to supervise and to see if they have any disciplinary sanctions.
- Look at how long they have been certified. We recommend identifying supervisors who have been certified for at least a year, if not longer. Note: BCBAs in their first year of certification who are supervising fieldwork must have a consulting supervisor.
- Gather information from the supervisor and past supervisees about the supervisor's style to make sure they are a good fit for you.
- Ask about their time and document-management systems. Caution: If you can't produce all of the necessary documents to support your fieldwork in the event of an audit, you might lose fieldwork hours, so you will want a very organized supervisor!
- Determine whether they are familiar with the BACB's requirements.
- Consider whether they could customize the fieldwork to your interests (while still meeting their ethical obligations as a BCBA to stay within their area of competence).

Once you have identified fieldwork site(s) and supervisor(s), complete the Fieldwork Checklist and Tip Sheet before you get started with each fieldwork site/supervisor. The BACB is not able to provide guidance beyond what is in our fieldwork requirements, as each situation is unique (e.g., whether a specific activity will qualify toward your fieldwork hours). Work together with your supervisor(s) to ensure that you are meeting the fieldwork requirements while also meeting your professional goals.

## A Few Final Tips

- Keep this handbook close by. We will update the handbook quarterly as needed, so always make sure that you are reviewing the most current handbook to see what has changed since the last version. It is also important that you become familiar with all applicable licensure requirements in your area.
- Frequently check the BACB website for new resources, including videos, blogs, and podcasts. For example, the Tips for New Certificants blog shares valuable information for newly certified individuals, and The Professional Infrastructure of Applied Behavior Analysis video describes the various organizations within the ABA profession.
- Get involved and engaged with your behavior-analytic community! This might include joining or volunteering with your local, regional, or national professional associations and groups focused in your area(s) of interest. You will likely learn a lot and have an opportunity to contribute to behavior analysis and its consumers. Having professional support is helpful at every stage of your career, so create opportunities to identify trusted colleague(s), mentors, and/or groups now.
- As you pursue certification, ensure that you do not represent yourself as a BCBA trainee or applicant to prevent consumers from being confused about your qualifications. For more information about use of the BCBA certification mark, see the September 2008, October 2013, and July 2021 BACB Newsletters.

**Demonstrate that you meet this requirement when you apply by submitting a curriculum vitae showing this experience, signed attestations describing the behavior-analytic practice from current or former employers, and proof of the applicable professional credential(s).**

### Supervised Fieldwork

You must complete supervised fieldwork in applied behavior analysis. You may accrue your fieldwork hours under Supervised Fieldwork. This fieldwork must have started once you have completed 10 years of postdoctoral experience. The following table provides a general overview. You should thoroughly review the Supervised Fieldwork Requirements section to ensure that you meet all of the detailed requirements.

#### Overview of Fieldwork Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Fieldwork hours required to qualify | 500 |
| Supervisor qualifications | Supervisors must meet one of the following criteria:<br/>• be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for at least one year, and meeting the ongoing supervision CEU requirement;<br/>• be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for less than one year, and receiving monthly consultation from a qualified consulting supervisor. |
| Supervision hours per supervisory period | 5% of hours |

**Demonstrate that you meet this requirement when you apply by submitting your signed Final Fieldwork Verification Form(s) (F-FVF).** Note: If your fieldwork is audited, you may need to submit an audit log and other documents, such as your supervision contract, Monthly Fieldwork Verification Forms (M-FVFs), and/or documentation system, to support the information entered in your audit log. All current fieldwork requirements must be met.

## Qualification for Examination via Past Certification

If your BCBA certification expired within the last five years, you may be able to requalify as a BCBA by sitting for and passing the BCBA certification examination. Qualification via past certification applications are only accepted from individuals residing in countries in which the BACB accepts new certification applications.

To be eligible for this option, you must also meet the following continuing education requirements:

- You obtained 16 continuing education units (CEUs) each year since the date your BCBA certification expired (prorated to the month you submit a Qualify for Examination via Past Certification Application).
- The CEUs you earned must meet the BACB's current CEU requirements and be entered into your BACB account before you submit your application. CEU documentation may include your previous certification number solely to connect it to a prior certification for this purpose.

If you become certified again via this option, you will receive a new certification number and recertification cycle. You must also adhere to the same requirements as a new certificant (e.g., 8-hour supervision training, consulting supervisor). Additional CEUs may be required if there is a delay in the application requirements (e.g., payment, documents received).

### Applying via Past Certification

If you want to apply for BCBA certification via this option, you must complete the required CEUs, document them in your BACB account, submit a Qualify for Examination via Past Certification Application, and submit payment after your reinstatement period has ended. If your application is approved and you are authorized to sit for the BCBA examination, you must pass the current version of the examination within the two-year authorization period (see the Examination section for more details).

# Eligibility Requirements

## Supervised Fieldwork Requirements

### Introduction

One of the core eligibility requirements for those pursuing BCBA certification (trainees) is completion of supervised fieldwork in applied behavior analysis. This experience allows trainees to apply what they have learned in coursework to real-world settings under the ongoing guidance and supervision of a qualified BCBA supervisor.

Supervised fieldwork not only strengthens technical skills but also helps trainees learn to collaborate and communicate effectively with consumers, supervisors, and families while maintaining high ethical and professional standards.

Individuals accruing their fieldwork hours must complete either **2,000 hours of Supervised Fieldwork** or—when the more intensive supervision requirements are met—**1,500 hours of Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork**. Trainees will complete all of these hours under the supervision of a qualified supervisor, typically someone working at the organization or university where they are completing their coursework.

Although trainees may accrue some of their fieldwork hours by directly implementing existing assessments and interventions with clients (i.e., restricted hours), at least **60% of the total hours must be spent conducting activities** for their clients that more closely represent the tasks they will perform after earning BCBA certification. These hours are referred to as **unrestricted hours** and may include a variety of activities, including, but not limited to:

- Conducting client observations and analyzing the data
- Developing programs for their clients
- Training staff and caregivers on behavior-analytic procedures
- Meeting with clients to discuss behavior-analytic services

While trainees complete their fieldwork hours, supervisors observe them working with clients and meet with them regularly throughout the month to support the development of their behavior-analytic, professional, and ethical repertoires, while also ensuring their clients receive high-quality services. Supervisors must provide fieldwork supervision and guidance in accordance with the requirements while adhering to the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts ("Code").

> **Note:** Although trainees may hold an RBT certification while completing their fieldwork hours, many of the tasks completed as part of RBT and RBT ongoing supervision requirements may not count toward fieldwork. See the 7 FAQs for RBTs Pursuing BCBA or BCaBA Certification blog post for more information.

### Overview of Fieldwork Requirements

| Requirement | Supervised Fieldwork | Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork |

| Fieldwork hours required to qualify | 2,000* | 1,500 |
| Supervisory period | 1 calendar month | 1 calendar month |
| Fieldwork hours per supervisory period | Minimum of 20 hours–maximum of 130 hours | Minimum of 20 hours–maximum of 130 hours |
| Number of contacts with supervisor per supervisory period | 4 contacts | 6 contacts |
| Observations with client per supervisory period | 1 observation | 1 observation |
| Supervision per supervisory period | 5% of hours | 10% of hours |
| Individual supervision hours per supervisory period | At least 50% of supervised hours must be individual (i.e., group supervision may not exceed 50%) | At least 50% of supervised hours must be individual (i.e., group supervision may not exceed 50%) |

# Eligibility Requirements

The following sections—Fieldwork Requirements, Supervision Requirements, and Documentation of Fieldwork—describe the requirements for supervised fieldwork (hereafter referred to as "fieldwork") in detail. Applicants applying for BCBA certification must meet all requirements at the time they apply, regardless of when their hours were earned.

If any of these requirements are not met, trainees may lose qualifying fieldwork hours, and a Notice of Alleged Violation (NAV) may be filed against the supervisor. As a result, trainees and supervisors need to stay up to date by reading the BACB Newsletter, Recent & Upcoming Changes to BACB Requirements, and by checking the Version History and Updates section at the end of the Handbook for any updates.

## Fieldwork Requirements

Supervisors must ensure that trainees are engaged in meaningful, real-world activities during fieldwork before applying for certification. Trainees are strongly encouraged to receive supervision from a variety of supervisors and work across various settings throughout their fieldwork experience to broaden their skills.

This section summarizes fieldwork requirements, including when fieldwork may begin, the specific fieldwork hour requirements, and which activities may and may not count as fieldwork.

### Starting Fieldwork

Trainees may not begin accumulating fieldwork hours until they have:

- Secured a qualified supervisor (see Supervisor Qualifications section)
- Developed and signed a supervision contract with each supervisor (see Supervision Contract section); AND
- If applying under pathway 1 or 2: Started qualifying graduate-level behavior-analytic coursework. (They may begin accruing hours after attending the first class meeting. For fieldwork hours to count, a passing grade of "C" or higher in a graded course or "pass" in a pass/fail system must be earned in this initial behavior-analytic course.); OR
- If applying under pathway 4: Completed 10 years of postdoctoral experience.

**Note:** Trainees should complete the Fieldwork Checklist and Tip Sheet and share it with the supervisor at each fieldwork setting before starting fieldwork.

### Hour Requirements

Trainees must complete a specific number of fieldwork hours.

#### Number of Hours by Fieldwork Type

To meet the fieldwork requirement, trainees must complete either 2,000 Supervised Fieldwork hours, 1,500 Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork hours, or a combination of the two (see the Combining Fieldwork Types information highlighted in the box below for more details). These totals include both independent hours (supervisor not present) and supervised hours (supervisor present). Each fieldwork type has different monthly requirements, so trainees and supervisors should review the Supervision Structures section for more information. Hours can only be accrued under one fieldwork type per month, per supervision structure, and all requirements of that fieldwork type must be met for the hours to count toward the fieldwork requirement.

#### Combining Fieldwork Types to Determine Total Hours

If hours are mixed across fieldwork types, trainees can estimate how close they are to meeting the total fieldwork hour requirement by following these steps:

1. Sum the total hours accrued under the Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork type.
2. Multiply the sum of the Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork hours by 1.33.
3. Add the total hours accrued under Supervised Fieldwork.
4. Ensure the combined total is at least 2,000 hours before applying for certification.

**Notes:**

- The 1.33 multiplier is only (a) applied to Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork hours and (b) used to reach the minimum combined total of mixed hours (i.e., Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork + Supervised Fieldwork).
- When documenting hours on the M-FVF, F-FVF, and in the certification application, trainees should record only the actual hours accrued, not the adjusted total with the multiplier.
- In the event of an audit, trainees must indicate in the Fieldwork Audit Log which hours have been adjusted to meet the requirements.

| Supervision Structure | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Individual Supervision | Supervision sessions must be individual (i.e., group supervision may not exceed 50%). |
| Unrestricted Activities | At least 60% of overall supervised fieldwork must be spent engaged in unrestricted activities. |

Updated 01/2026, Copyright© 2026, BACB® | All rights reserved. Behavior Analyst Certification Board | Board Certified Behavior Analyst® Handbook | 15

# Eligibility Requirements

## Accrual of Fieldwork

Trainees must accrue no fewer than 20 and no more than 130 hours of fieldwork per calendar month.

## Duration of Fieldwork

Fieldwork must be completed within five continuous years (e.g., May 1, 2020, to April 30, 2025). Note: The five years are calculated by calendar month, not date-to-date.

## Multiple Settings and/or Supervisors

Trainees may accrue hours in multiple settings to reach the total hour requirements; however, they must meet all relevant requirements for each organized fieldwork experience (i.e., for each Monthly Fieldwork Verification Form (M-FVF) and Final Fieldwork Verification Form (F-FVF)) for every month of accrual. For example, if a trainee is accruing some hours with an individual supervisor in one setting and some hours with multiple supervisors in another setting, the trainee must independently meet the requirements at each site.

# Fieldwork Activities

The trainee's primary focus should be on acquiring the skills necessary to demonstrate competence in behavior-analytic practice and the skills necessary to interact effectively with consumers, supervisors, families, and others.

## Appropriate Clients

Any person (or group of people) for whom behavior-analytic services are appropriate may be a client. The trainee and supervisor must have a formal relationship with the client who is receiving services as part of the fieldwork activities. This may occur in one of the following situations:

- The trainee and supervisor are working at the same organization where the client is receiving behavior-analytic services.
- The trainee and supervisor each have a service contract with a specific client.
- The trainee and supervisor have a contractual relationship with the organization where the client is receiving services.

However, the trainee may not be related to the client, be the client's primary caregiver, or be related to the client's primary caregiver.

## Acceptable Activities

All fieldwork hours must be related to specific client programming. Trainees must work with, be observed by, and receive feedback from their supervisor for multiple clients over the course of their fieldwork hours.

In addition, trainees are strongly encouraged to have multiple experiences (e.g., different settings, populations), work with multiple supervisors, and gain experience in each of these areas:

- Conducting assessments related to the need for behavioral intervention (e.g., stimulus preference assessments, functional assessments, staff performance assessments) or for evaluating behavioral interventions
- Designing, implementing, and systematically monitoring skill-acquisition and behavior-reduction programs
- Writing behavior plans, progress summaries, clinical notes, transition summaries, and professional correspondence
- Overseeing the implementation of behavior-analytic programs by others
- Training others, designing behavioral systems, and managing performance
- Communicating and collaborating effectively with stakeholders and other professionals
- Engaging in other activities typically performed by behavior analysts that are directly related to behavior analysis, such as attending planning meetings for a behavior-analytic program or researching literature relevant to a current client's programming

# ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

## Unacceptable Activities

Only behavior-analytic activities that are specific to a client may be counted toward fieldwork requirements. Non-behavior-analytic activities, while valuable, may not be counted. Examples of activities that will not count as fieldwork include:

- attending professional conferences, workshops, or university courses
- completing didactic-course assignments (e.g., homework assignments, readings) and quizzes
- attending meetings with little or no behavior-analytic content
- providing interventions that are not based in behavior analysis
- performing non-behavior-analytic administrative activities
- participating in non-behavior-analytic trainings related to service delivery (e.g., crisis management, CPR, billing systems)
- completing non-behavior-analytic assessments (e.g., diagnostic or intellectual assessments), paperwork, documentation, billing, or any other activities that are not directly related to behavior analysis
- listening to podcasts
- role-playing behavior-analytic procedures that are not client related

## Can the BACB tell me if an activity counts toward my fieldwork hours?

Because every trainee's goals are unique—and we cannot possibly know or anticipate all of the situational variables, populations, and settings in which they may be working—we cannot provide guidance beyond our certification requirements. However, your supervisors should review these requirements closely to determine whether the activities are in line with all of the requirements and best support the clients' needs and trainees' goals.

## Types of Fieldwork Activity

To ensure trainees obtain skills in the activities most representative of tasks performed by BCBAs, at least 60% of their total fieldwork hours must be accrued from times when trainees are engaged in "unrestricted activities." This 60% requirement does not need to be met each calendar month (i.e., the supervisory period), but must be satisfied across the total accumulated fieldwork hours.

### Unrestricted Activities

Activities that are unrestricted are those that are most likely to be performed by a BCBA. Unrestricted activities must comprise at least 60% of the total fieldwork hours (e.g., at least 1,200 hours of unrestricted activities out of 2,000 hours of Supervised Fieldwork). Examples of unrestricted activities include:

- observation and data collection
- training staff and caregivers on behavior-analytic programs or content
- conducting assessments related to the need for behavioral intervention
- meeting with clients about behavior-analytic programming and services
- conducting behavior-analytic assessments (e.g., functional analyses, stimulus preference assessments)
- data graphing and analysis
- researching the literature relevant to a current client's programming
- writing and revising behavior-analytic programs

### Restricted Activities

There is a restriction on the overall number of hours trainees may spend delivering therapeutic and instructional procedures during fieldwork. This restriction is designed to ensure that trainees have sufficient time to acquire the other skills necessary for practice as a BCBA. Restricted activities may comprise no more than 40% of the total fieldwork hours. There is no minimum requirement for restricted hours. This restriction does not necessarily refer to all time spent working with clients. For example, data collection could be a restricted activity if a trainee collects data solely as part of a client's treatment program.

# ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

## Supervision Requirements

Because fieldwork supervisors shape the behavior of future behavior analysts and are essential in ensuring that the trainees' clients receive high-quality services, they play a vital role in fieldwork supervision. This section describes who may provide fieldwork supervision and the requirements they must follow.

### Supervisor Qualifications

Supervisors must meet one of the following criteria:

- be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for at least one year, and meeting the ongoing supervision CEU requirement; OR
- be an active BCBA with no current disciplinary sanctions, certified for less than one year, meeting the ongoing supervision CEU requirement, and receiving monthly prior consultation from a qualified consulting supervisor.

All supervisors must also:

- complete an 8-hour supervision training (trainees may confirm their supervisor has completed this training by looking up their supervisor in the BACB Certificant Registry) and upload the certificate to their BACB account before signing a supervision contract. Trainees should confirm the date on which the supervisor completed the training before signing a supervision contract.
- ensure that they are not related to, subordinate to, employed by, or in a multiple relationship (e.g., personal or business relationship) with the trainee during the fieldwork period. Employment does not include compensation paid to the supervisor by the trainee for supervision services.
- abide by the Code, including the Responsibilities to Supervisee and Trainees section. An NAV may be submitted against a supervisor for not providing supervision in accordance with these requirements.

**Note:** A supervisor may have been either (a) a licensed, registered psychologist certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology, or (b) a non-certified Verified Course Sequence Instructor prior to January 1, 2026. Fieldwork hours accrued under these supervisors may be used toward fieldwork requirements until December 31, 2031.

### Looking for a Supervisor?

Choosing the right supervisor is essential and should be based on your specific situation. You can start by inquiring whether there is someone at your organization who is qualified and willing to supervise your fieldwork hours. Additionally, consider asking faculty members at your university for guidance. You may also use the BACB Certificant Registry to identify individuals who are willing to supervise trainees. Keep in mind that all of your hours must be connected to direct client services, so it's important that your supervisor has a direct relationship with, or oversight of, the clients with whom you will be working.

## Supervision Structures

A supervisor may either provide all of the supervision to a trainee each month (Individual Supervision) or collaborate with other supervisors at their organization to meet the fieldwork requirements for a trainee (Multiple Supervisors at One Organization). The following section describes the requirements for each structure.

### Individual Supervisors

An individual supervisor must ensure that all of their trainees' fieldwork requirements are being met during their supervision. In this situation:

- the supervision contract must clearly outline the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of both the trainee and the supervisor (see the Supervision Contract section);
- all supervision must be related to specific client programming;
- the supervisor must have written permission to receive client information and must be well informed about the organization's values, practices, and personnel; AND
- the person signing the M-FVFs and F-FVFs for Individual Supervisors must be able to agree to all of the relevant attestations, including that all fieldwork requirements were met.

# ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

## Multiple Supervisors at One Organization

When multiple supervisors work within the same organization, they may coordinate to oversee a trainee's fieldwork. For example, a service organization may have multiple supervisors providing supervision, or a university may coordinate all on- and off-campus activities under one system. The supervisors must work together to ensure that all of their trainees' fieldwork requirements are met (e.g., all hours provided by the supervisors are used to calculate the supervision percentage). One supervisor must ensure that the activity is well organized and coordinated. In this situation:

- The supervision contract must list all supervisors and clearly outline the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of each supervisor and the trainee (see the Supervision Contract section)
- All supervisors must sign the contract
- All supervision must be related to specific client programming
- The supervisor(s) must have written permission to receive client information and must be well informed about the organization's values, practices, and personnel; AND
- The person signing the M-FVFs and F-FVFs for Multiple Supervisors at One Organization (i.e., the responsible supervisor) must be able to agree to all relevant attestations, including that all fieldwork requirements were met. Note: The Responsible Supervisor must meet all supervision requirements for the entire duration of the M-FVF or F-FVF they sign.

## Supervisor Responsibilities

When behavior analysts are functioning as supervisors, they must take full responsibility for all facets of the supervisory experience. Therefore, it is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure that the trainee abides by all ethical and legal requirements. Responsibilities of the supervisor include:

- Being proficient in and compliant with all BACB requirements relating to fieldwork
- Confirming that the trainee has met all requirements before the outset of supervised fieldwork
- Consistently demonstrating technical, professional, and ethical behavior for the trainee
- Ensuring that fieldwork activities are in the best interest of the client rather than solely for the purpose of meeting the fieldwork requirements
- Providing supervision only within their areas of defined competence
- Taking on a volume of supervisory activity that is commensurate with their ability to be effective
- Delegating to their trainees only those responsibilities that trainees can reasonably be expected to perform competently, ethically, and safely—or providing the conditions for trainees to acquire those skills in an ethical and safe manner
- Ensuring that supervision, fieldwork activities, and trainings are behavior-analytic in content, are effectively and ethically designed, and meet the requirements for licensure, certification, or other defined goals
- Providing a clear written description of the purpose, requirements, evaluation criteria, conditions, and terms of supervision before the onset of supervision (i.e., behavior analysts are responsible for developing and executing the supervision contract). See the Supervision Contract section
- Designing and implementing feedback and reinforcement systems in a way that improves trainee performance
- Providing documented, timely feedback regarding the trainee's performance on an ongoing basis; AND
- Designing systems for obtaining ongoing evaluation of their own supervision activities

## Amount of Supervision

Based on the type of fieldwork hours accrued, the trainee must have 5% (Supervised Fieldwork) or 10% (Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork) of their hours supervised by a qualified supervisor each calendar month. The supervision percentage is calculated by dividing supervised hours by total fieldwork hours (i.e., independent and supervised hours).

# ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

## Nature of Supervision

The purpose of supervision is to improve and maintain the behavior-analytic, professional, and ethical repertoires of the trainee and to facilitate the delivery of high-quality services to the trainee's clients. Effective behavior-analytic supervision includes:

- Monitoring the skills of the trainee throughout the supervised fieldwork
- Developing and communicating performance expectations to the trainee
- Conducting behavioral skills training for the trainee
- Observing the trainee's performance with clients and delivering feedback
- Modeling technical, professional, and ethical behavior
- Guiding the development of behavioral case conceptualization, problem-solving, and decision-making repertoires
- Reviewing the trainee's written materials (e.g., behavior programs, data sheets, reports) and delivering related feedback on these products
- Overseeing and evaluating the effects of the trainee's behavior-analytic service delivery
- Evaluating the effects of supervision throughout supervised fieldwork

## Structure of Supervision Interactions

The supervisor must meet with the trainee throughout the supervisory period (i.e., the calendar month) to provide frequent feedback and close oversight of their activities. Supervision may occur in individual or group meetings; however, at least half of the meeting time must be in individual meetings. Additionally, the supervisor must observe the trainee with the client(s) they are serving during each supervisory period. The following section describes these supervision requirements in more detail.

### Supervisor-Trainee Contact

A real-time interaction between the supervisor and trainee that takes place in an individual or group format. There must be at least four supervisor-trainee contacts each supervisory period for supervised fieldwork and six contacts per supervisory period for concentrated supervised fieldwork.

### Individual Supervision

Individual supervision occurs in one-on-one meetings between a supervisor and trainee. At least 50% of the supervision meeting time must be individual supervision each supervisory period.

### Group Supervision

Group supervision is an interactive meeting in which 2 to 10 trainees who share similar experiences participate in the supervision activities described earlier (see the Nature of Supervision section). The number of trainees in a group meeting may not exceed 10 at any time, regardless of the number of supervisors present. If non-trainees are present, their participation should be limited, and their presence must not inhibit discussion or interfere with trainee participation. Unless the trainee is receiving supervision at an organization with multiple supervisors, group supervision must be provided by the same supervisor who provides individual supervision. Group supervision hours may not exceed half of the total supervised hours in each supervisory period.

### Observation of the Trainee with a Client

At least one supervisor must observe the trainee working with a client in the natural environment during each supervisory period. In-person, on-site observation is preferred; however, the observation may be conducted using asynchronous (e.g., recorded video) or synchronous (e.g., live video conference) formats.

**Note:** The time a supervisor spends observing a trainee may also count as a supervision contact and as fieldwork hours if feedback is provided and the interaction occurs in real time. For example, if your supervisor watches an hour-long video of you delivering services but does not provide immediate, real-time feedback, that hour may count toward the observation-with-a-client requirement, but not the supervisor-trainee contact or total supervised hours requirement. However, if you and your supervisor watch the video together, pausing to discuss feedback and behavior-analytic principles, the hour could count toward all requirements at once.

# Eligibility Requirements

## Documentation of Fieldwork

To show that fieldwork requirements have been fulfilled, specific documentation requirements must be met. Only the F-FVF will need to be submitted as part of the BCBA certification application; however, the trainee must be prepared to submit all of the information described below in the event that their fieldwork is audited by the BACB. The following sections describe the documentation requirements.

### Supervision Contract

Before supervision may begin, the trainee and supervisor(s) must develop and sign a written contract at the outset of the supervisory relationship. The purpose of the contract is to protect all involved parties and align fieldwork activities with the purpose of supervision. The contract should include:

- The responsibilities of the supervisor(s) and trainee, including the completion of the 8-hour supervision training by the supervisor(s) and adherence by all parties to the fieldwork requirements
- If there are multiple supervisors at one organization, a single contract may be used, but it must outline each supervisor's roles, responsibilities, and expectations, including how documentation and forms will be completed. All parties are required to sign the supervision contract.
- A description of the appropriate activities and training objectives individualized to the trainee
- The objective and measurable circumstances under which the supervisor(s) will not sign the trainee's M-FVF and F-FVF
- The consequences if the parties do not adhere to their responsibilities (including proper termination of the relationship)
- A statement requiring the trainee to obtain written permission from their on-site employer or manager, when applicable
- An attestation that all parties will adhere to the Code
- A statement declaring that the trainee and supervisor(s):
  - (a) will retain a copy of the contract and supervision documentation for at least seven years from the date of the final supervision meeting, and
  - (b) will provide all documentation to the BACB if requested

Please note that the original supervision contracts may be amended throughout the supervisory relationship; however, each amendment must be signed and dated by all relevant parties.

### Ongoing Documentation of Fieldwork

Because fieldwork varies across settings and practice areas, the BACB gives supervisors and trainees the flexibility to develop their own system for documenting ongoing supervision and fieldwork in a way that demonstrates adherence to all relevant requirements and the Code.

| Independent Hours | Supervised Hours | Observations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| For each session, document: • date • start time • end time • fieldwork type • supervisor name • activity category: restricted or unrestricted | For each supervision contact, document: • date • start time • end time • fieldwork type • supervision type: individual or group • activity category: restricted or unrestricted • summary of supervision activity (e.g., discussion of activities completed during independent hours, feedback provided, progress toward goals discussed) | For each observation, document: • date • start time • end time • fieldwork type • setting name • supervisor name • activity category: restricted or unrestricted |

---

Updated 01/2026, Copyright© 2026, BACB® | All rights reserved. Behavior Analyst Certification Board | Board Certified Behavior Analyst® Handbook

# Eligibility Requirements

In addition to tracking data by day and supervision contact, the documentation system should be regularly reviewed to ensure that all relevant requirements are met each supervision period and across all fieldwork hours. This includes tracking:

- **Each Supervisory Period**: The trainee and supervisor should have documentation that shows they are meeting the quantitative requirements (e.g., minimum number of supervisory meetings and contacts) and qualitative requirements (e.g., a summary of what happened during the supervision meeting).
- **Across All Fieldwork Hours**: The trainee should have documentation showing that they are accruing the minimum number of unrestricted hours and making progress.

## Fieldwork Verification Forms

For every supervision structure, the responsible supervisor and trainee must complete either an **Individual Supervision Monthly Fieldwork Verification Form (M-FVF)** or a **Multiple Supervisors at One Organization Monthly Fieldwork Verification Form (M-FVF)** (depending on their supervision structure) every month to document the hours that count for that month. The M-FVF must be signed by the last date of the calendar month following the month of supervision.

At the end of the fieldwork experience under each supervision structure, the responsible supervisor and trainee will use the signed M-FVFs to determine the total hours that can be counted for that fieldwork experience and complete the **Individual Supervision Final Fieldwork Verification Form (F-FVF)** or a **Multiple Supervisors at One Organization Final Fieldwork Verification Form (F-FVF)** (depending on their supervision structure). 

**Note:** Taking a break from accruing fieldwork under the same supervision contract constitutes a new supervision experience.

The F-FVF will be submitted in the certification application, and the M-FVFs may be requested if the fieldwork is audited. Multiple F-FVFs can be submitted in an application to demonstrate that the combined fieldwork experiences meet the total required fieldwork hours.

Both parties must retain a copy of the completed fieldwork forms for at least **seven years after obtaining certification**. Outdated BACB forms or non-BACB forms will not be accepted. To ensure you are using the most current version, refer to the Document Versions section on the Application Processing Updates web page.

> **Is there a disagreement about signing these forms?** See the Disputes About Fieldwork Verification Form Signatures document for guidance.

# Eligibility Requirements

## Adjusting and Documenting Fieldwork Hours When Monthly Requirements Are Not Met

After all fieldwork hours in a month have been documented, the trainee must determine whether they met the minimum requirements before completing the M-FVF. If a trainee does not meet all of the monthly fieldwork requirements (e.g., not enough supervisor contacts, supervision percentage is too low), the trainee will work with their supervisor to determine whether they may systematically reduce their hours to meet the requirements.

The following table describes each monthly fieldwork requirement and the associated adjustment if the requirement is not met within a month. Please note that concentrated hours may not be prorated or adjusted.

Once the hours have been adjusted, the trainee will record the adjusted hours on the M-FVF. Note: The fieldwork documentation system will still need to include all of the hours accrued for the month (i.e., the unadjusted hours).

| Requirement Not Met | Adjustment to the Month's Fieldwork Hours |
|---|---|
| No observation of the trainee working with a client | No hours are eligible for the month. |
| Fewer than 20 total hours | No hours are eligible for the month. |
| More than 130 total hours | Remove independent hours for the month until the total equals 130 hours. |
| Not enough supervisor-trainee contacts | Take the total hours accrued in the month (up to 130) and prorate the hours based on the percentage of contacts that met the requirement. For example, if 2 out of 4 required contacts occurred (i.e., 50% of the contacts were met) and there were 110 total hours accrued in the month, multiply 110 hours by .50 (i.e., 50%) to determine the total hours that can count (i.e., 55 eligible hours). |
| Group supervision is more than individual supervision | Reduce the group supervision hours until they equal (or are less than) the individual supervision hours. |
| % of supervision did not meet the minimum requirement | Decrease the independent hours for the month until the % of supervision meets (or exceeds) the minimum monthly requirement. |
| Monthly Fieldwork Verification Form (M-FVF) is not signed by the last day of the calendar month following the month of supervision | No hours are eligible for the month. |

# ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

## Audits

The BACB may audit trainees and supervisors at any time to determine compliance with BACB requirements. See the following figure for an overview of the fieldwork audit process.

### Fieldwork Audit Process

#### AUDIT INITIATED

The BACB may initiate a fieldwork audit at any time for any reason. For instance, it might be initiated as part of a quality assurance check, contested fieldwork, or ethics-related matter. Note: In the event that a certification application is audited for fieldwork, application processing will be suspended until completion of the audit.

#### BACB REQUESTS AUDIT INFORMATION

The BACB will contact the trainee and/or supervisor by email. The audit may require submission of the supervision contract, consulting supervisor meetings (if the supervisor was in their first year of supervision), M-FVFs, the documentation system, and/or an audit log (or other supervisor-related documents as described in the Documentation Requirements section).

#### PARTIES SUBMIT AUDIT DOCUMENTS TO BACB

All relevant parties will submit requested documents to the BACB as directed in the audit initiation email within the specified time frame, typically 14 days. Documents submitted after the deadline will not be reviewed or considered in the determination. Note: If the BACB does not receive a response in the specified time frame, the fieldwork will be considered noncompliant.

#### BACB REVIEWS INFORMATION

BACB staff will review information submitted to evaluate compliance with the fieldwork requirements and other applicable BACB requirements. If additional documents or information is required, relevant parties will be notified via email.

#### BACB PROVIDES A DETERMINATION AND FEEDBACK

The BACB will contact the trainee and supervisor with the results of the audit. If the BACB concludes that some or all of the fieldwork was not in compliance with the fieldwork requirements or any other applicable BACB requirements, some or all of the fieldwork may be disqualified.*

*A Notice of Alleged Violation may also be submitted against the trainee's supervisor(s) if portions of the trainee's fieldwork are not in compliance with the requirements.

Once you meet all applicable eligibility requirements, submit your application, and receive an approved determination, you must take and pass the BCBA certification examination. This examination assesses your knowledge of the BCBA Test Content Outline (6th ed.) at a level consistent with that of an entry-level behavior analyst.

**Note:** Candidates permitted to take the BCBA examination will test under the current edition of the test content outline (TCO). If a new edition goes into effect while a candidate's authorization period is active, they must test under the new edition. Exceptions will not be granted.

## Examination Development

Job task analysis (JTA) is the predominant method for developing high-stakes examinations for professions, and it has been used in the development of all BACB examinations. The JTA process involves the development of the following:
- A draft task list
- A content-validation survey of the profession that active BACB certificants are invited to participate in
- A new examination blueprint (also known as a test content outline)

The BCBA examination is currently based on the BCBA Test Content Outline (6th ed.).

## Preparation

The BACB recommends that you prepare for the BCBA examination by reviewing the following:
- BCBA Test Content Outline (6th ed.)
- Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts
- Materials gathered from your training

The BACB cannot endorse specific study guides or other preparation materials, and the purchase of any study materials does not guarantee that you will pass the examination.

## Examination Outline

The BCBA examination includes 175 scored questions and 10 unscored questions. The test content outline consists of 104 tasks (tasks that a behavior analyst should be able to perform) organized into 9 content areas (broad areas of knowledge and skills necessary to perform the role).

Each question has 4 possible answers and only 1 correct answer. Candidates have 4 hours to complete the examination. All questions on the BCBA examination are equally weighted.

Your examination result will be based on your overall performance on the examination, not on the performance in each content area. For a complete list of all content areas on the BCBA examination, please see the test content outline.

The following retired questions appeared on previous administrations of the BCBA examination and represent content areas that are currently on the examination. These questions are provided to offer candidates insight into the format of the BCBA examination.

### Question 1

Which of the following BEST describes the purpose of a multiple stimulus (without replacement) preference assessment?

A. To determine which skills to teach
B. To identify the function of problem behavior
C. To assess the sensory characteristics of different stimuli
D. To determine relative preference among several potential reinforcers

### Question 2

A BCBA notices that a trainee frequently agrees with caregivers to avoid conflict, even when their statements contradict the client's behavior plan.

Given this situation, how should the BCBA provide feedback to the trainee?

A. Praise the trainee for maintaining positive relationships with caregivers to support collaboration.
B. Emphasize the ethical obligation to act in the client's best interest and teach strategies for respectful disagreement.
C. Recommend that the trainee discuss any caregiver disagreements privately to avoid disrupting rapport.

An Examination Retake Application will be available online via your BACB account within 48 hours of each failed examination attempt. You will receive an examination authorization email within 48 hours of submitting the Examination Retake Application, which will provide further instructions on how to schedule a new examination appointment.

You must pay a $140 retake application fee and a $125 examination appointment fee each time you retake the examination. You must wait 30 days to retake the examination following your previous attempt.

**Note:** If you do not pass the examination after 8 attempts and still have time in your 2-year authorization period, you must wait until your 2-year authorization period is over to reapply for BCBA certification.

# Examination Accommodations

Examination accommodations are available for individuals with a current disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or a comparable human rights law in their country.

## Required Documentation

Accommodation requests must include:
- The BACB Examination Accommodation Request Form
- Documentation from a qualified professional (e.g., physician, school official, licensed psychiatrist, licensed psychologist)

Appropriate documentation must identify the disability and state the need for the requested accommodation(s).

Examples of appropriate documentation include:
- Official letters
- Reports of test results
- Documentation of past accommodation(s) received, including accommodation(s) received for standardized testing (e.g., previous Individualized Education Plan [IEP], documentation from another organization similar to the BACB)

## Submission and Review Process

All documentation must be compiled into a single PDF file and submitted through the Submit Accommodations Documentation web page. Once the accommodation request and supporting documentation have been received, the BACB will conduct a review, which typically takes 10–14 days. The BACB may require additional documentation, which can result in longer processing times.

Individuals should not attempt to schedule their examination until they receive an email about the status of their accommodation request and how to schedule their examination.

**Please note:** Certification applications and accommodation requests are reviewed separately, and the approval of a certification application does not constitute the approval of an accommodation request.

# Prior to Your Examination Appointment

Before your BCBA examination appointment, review your confirmation email from Pearson VUE to confirm your appointment details and testing center location. Knowing the testing center's location will enable you to plan and arrive with plenty of time to spare.

The BCBA examination is administered using a computer-based testing (CBT) format at all Pearson VUE testing centers. To familiarize yourself with the CBT format and testing center expectations, visit Pearson VUE's BACB Certification Testing web page, which offers the following:

- Pearson VUE demo test
- Pearson VUE Candidate Rules Agreement
- Online tour of a Pearson Professional Center

# EXAMINATION

## What to Expect on Examination Day

You are advised to arrive approximately 30 minutes before your examination appointment to allow sufficient time to complete all necessary check-in procedures. Listen to all instructions from the testing-center staff and read all directions thoroughly. The check-in process includes verification of your identification, agreement to Testing Center rules, palm vein scanning, and a digital photograph.

The check-in process will be conducted in English only. Translators or interpreters are not allowed at testing centers, including print, electronic, or in-person translators, unless you have an approved accommodation. Testing-center staff will not act as translators during the check-in and/or testing process. If you cannot complete the check-in process, you will be turned away from the testing center, and all paid fees will be forfeited.

### Identification Requirements

You must provide one form of valid identification to be admitted into the examination area. The identification must show your first and last name exactly as it appears in your BACB account. Any name discrepancy will prevent admission to the examination. The identification must be:

- Government issued and original (not a photocopy or digital ID)
- Have your signature
- Include a recognizable photo
- Be current (i.e., not expired)

Failure to present valid identification will prevent admission to the testing center. If this happens, you will be turned away and all paid fees will be forfeited.

#### Examples of Acceptable IDs

# EXAMINATION

## What to Expect When Taking Your Examination

The BCBA examination is only offered in English.

The BCBA examination is 4 hours and consists of 185 multiple-choice questions; 175 scored questions and 10 unscored questions. Each question has 4 possible answers and only 1 correct answer. The time allocated includes reviewing the Terms and Conditions, exam navigation tutorial, load time prompt, and the examination (plus any review).

You will be monitored by Pearson VUE testing-center staff throughout your examination. Any misconduct will be documented and may result in the dismissal of your examination. You are not permitted to remove any examination materials from the examination area.

Be sure to keep your ID with you during the examination after the administrator checks you in. The only items permitted into the examination area are your one form of ID and your locker key. Breaks during the examination are taken on your own time. The clock does not stop if you take a break during the examination. Security protocols will be in effect as you exit and re-enter the testing room. During breaks, you are prohibited from accessing phones, electronic devices, notes, or other stored items. However, you can access food, drink, or medication during breaks. Additionally, you cannot leave the building at any time during your examination.

All testing centers provide earplugs upon request, and some also provide noise-canceling headphones. Additionally, a dry-erase board will be provided.

## Examination Terms and Conditions

Before the start of your BCBA examination, you must read and agree to the following examination Terms and Conditions. Failure to agree will result in immediate dismissal from the examination administration and forfeiture of your examination attempt and paid fees. The time spent reviewing these Terms and Conditions is part of your examination time.

### Confidentiality

- YOU ARE PERMANENTLY PROHIBITED FROM DISCLOSING THE CONTENT OF BACB EXAMINATION QUESTIONS. Such prohibition includes, but is not limited to, verbal, written, and/or electronic (e.g., email, social media, online study sites) disclosure. Because BACB examinations are copyright protected and highly confidential trade secrets, any disclosure, transmission, or reconstruction of examination questions or content to other individuals, organizations, or study groups is a violation of BACB rules and is subject to damages, including, but not limited to:
  - BACB investigation fees, court costs, and legal fees
  - The cost of replacing the compromised question(s)
  - The cost of reconstructing the examination at the discretion of the BACB

- The BACB reserves the right to report examination content theft to applicable law enforcement authorities.

- You authorize the BACB to release your name, examination performance data, audio and video files from the examination administration, and any other pertinent information necessary to demonstrate the basis for finding that you participated in or benefited from theft of BACB examination content.

- You may not communicate with other examinees or other individuals besides testing center staff during the examination.

### Test Security

- BACB examinations may only be taken by individuals (i.e., you) wishing to apply for BACB certification and for no other purpose. Third parties not approved by the BACB are not allowed in your examination administration.

- You will be continuously monitored by video (e.g., face) and audio (e.g., voice) while taking the examination. You recognize and consent that you have no right to privacy before, during, and after the examination delivery in the testing center and that you waive all claims asserting a right to privacy.

# EXAMINATION

## Electronic Devices and Study Materials

- You are prohibited from using any electronic device while the examination is in progress (e.g., cell phone, Bluetooth glasses, smartwatches). Additionally, you cannot access or be in possession of any study materials, documents, or notes at the testing center. The access or use of these unauthorized materials and/or devices is grounds for termination of the examination administration, invalidation of examination results, and/or other disciplinary action by the BACB.

- Any items worn by the candidate before or during the examination, including, but not limited to, cell phones, electronic devices, glasses, head scarves/shawls/wraps, bags, purses, and jewelry, may be investigated at the discretion of the examination proctor.

## Proctor Authority and Prohibited Conduct

- Proctors are authorized to maintain a secure and proper examination administration and assist with operational issues but will not provide comments or recommendations regarding examination questions.

- Tampering with Pearson VUE's software or equipment, cheating, or permitting cheating (e.g., letting someone copy answers, letting someone provide answers, providing information on the content of examination questions to others, recording or photographing test questions) is cause for termination of the examination administration, invalidation of examination results, and/or other disciplinary action by the BACB.

## Disciplinary Action for Irregular Behavior

At the sole discretion of the BACB and/or Pearson VUE, any irregular, disruptive, inappropriate, or suspected cheating behavior by you before, during, or after the examination may result in any combination of the following:

- Relocation or removal from the testing center
- Banning from the testing center in the future
- Immediate termination of examination delivery
- Invalidation of examination results
- Inactivation of examination authorization pending investigation of the irregularity
- Inactivation of certification pending investigation of the irregularity
- A required retest to validate your examination results
- Temporary or permanent restriction on sitting for any future BACB examination
- Another disciplinary action related to eligibility or certification status
- Forfeiture of all paid application and examination fees
- Any other remedy necessary to protect BACB examination content and security

## Breaks

- You are able to take unscheduled breaks (e.g., restroom) during the examination; however, you may not leave the testing center or facility at any point during your examination. Doing so will result in termination of the examination and forfeiture of your examination attempt and paid fees.

- You may take as many breaks as you need during the examination; however, the time spent on breaks will be deducted from the time allotted for your examination. You must follow all rules set forth by the testing center staff when requesting an unscheduled break.

- You will not be permitted to use a cell phone, any other electronic devices, study materials, or access your vehicle during your unscheduled break. Accessing unauthorized devices or materials will constitute cheating and result in dismissal from your examination and forfeiture of your examination attempt and paid fees.

## Examination Security

The BACB and Pearson VUE take examination security seriously because the value of your certification and our credibility depend on it. BCBA certification examination content is confidential; it is never appropriate to share, discuss, post, or upload examination content. In addition, candidates are required to adhere to the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts, which includes the following requirement: "Behavior analysts are truthful and arrange the professional environment to promote truthful behavior in others."

Unauthorized possession, reproduction, publication, or disclosure of any BACB examination materials—including storing or disclosing examination questions to any person or entity by any means before, during, or after the examination—is prohibited. Individuals violating these terms will not be permitted to retest or take any BACB examination until the matter has been resolved and the BACB has determined whether the candidate can have access to BACB examinations. Examples of violations and misconduct include:

---

**Updated 01/2026, Copyright© 2026, BACB® | All rights reserved. Behavior Analyst Certification Board | Board Certified Behavior Analyst® Handbook**

# EXAMINATION

## Violations and Misconduct

Examples of violations and misconduct include:

- Submitting false, inconsistent, or misleading statements or omitting information the BACB requests
- Attempting to take the examination for someone else or having someone else take the examination for you
- Copying or sharing information or any other form of cheating
- Obtaining advanced access to examination materials
- Stealing examination materials
- Bringing prohibited items into the examination room
- Failing to follow directions from testing-center staff
- Violating Pearson VUE scheduling or testing-center rules and regulations

## Examination Appeals

The BACB is committed to reporting valid examination results; however, certain circumstances may cause results to be invalidated. The BACB reserves the right to invalidate examination results and certification status due to suspected or documented misconduct during testing or violation of the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts. The Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts requires certificants, candidates, and applicants to immediately report any confirmed or suspected examination misconduct by others to the BACB.

Additionally, invalidation may also occur due to situations beyond your control—or that of the BACB's—at the testing site. If you experience examination condition irregularities (e.g., poor lighting or disruptive noises at the testing site, long screen-load times) during your examination, you may file an examination appeal with the BACB. Pearson VUE delivers BACB examinations via a web browser, so minor Internet bandwidth variances are to be expected.

BACB standards, requirements, deadlines, procedures, fees, examination content, examination delivery modality, examination results, examination edition, and examination-specific questions/answers may not be appealed.

### How to Appeal

You must file a request for appeal within 7 days of your examination appointment by completing the Administrative Appeal Request Form.

## Examination Results

The BCBA examination is pass/fail. After completing your examination, you will receive your result at the testing center. The BACB does not have the ability to view or download your examination result report. To obtain a copy, you must log into your Pearson VUE account and select "View Score Reports."

If you pass the BCBA examination, you will receive an email communication from the BACB within one week regarding your BCBA certification. The BACB Certificant Registry will be updated to include those who passed the examination approximately 2 weeks following the passing examination result.

If you fail the BCBA examination, you will need to submit a retake application, which will be available in your BACB account within 48 hours, to take the examination again. You must wait 30 days to retake the examination following your previous attempt.

## Scoring Methodology

The BACB uses the modified Angoff method to establish the BCBA examination's passing score. This method is criterion-referenced, meaning that the passing score is determined by a panel of BACB-certified subject matter experts and then approved by the BACB Board of Directors. Your performance on the examination is solely dependent on your understanding of entry-level behavior analyst knowledge.

A new passing score is established when a significant change to the industry or examination content occurs (e.g., introduction of a new test content outline).

# What to Expect After Passing the Examination

## What happens after I leave the testing center?

In most instances, you will receive a pass/fail report at the testing center. If you passed the examination, your BCBA certification number will be generated and available in your BACB account within 24 hours of passing the examination. You will receive your BCBA certificate in the mail within 4–6 weeks (so make sure that your mailing address is correct in your BACB account).

## When can I start using my BCBA certification?

You may start using your BCBA certification as soon as you have passed the examination. However, please contact your state, regional, or national behavior-analytic professional associations to learn about any additional requirements for practice as a behavior analyst in your region and to access valuable support in the profession.

If you reside in a US state where behavior analysts are licensed, you should immediately contact your state licensure board to determine whether or how you should submit an application for licensure before practicing with your new BACB certification.

**Please note:** Starting January 1, 2025, once you pass the BCBA examination, any other BACB certification you hold will expire after 180 days or on its expiration date, whichever comes first. See the March 2025 BACB Newsletter for more information.

## How can employers and funders, among others, verify my certification?

Newly certified BCBAs appear in the BACB Certificant Registry within 48 hours of passing the examination. The Certificant Registry shows the status of your certification and recertification date, and if your certification becomes inactive for any reason, this will be indicated on the registry.

Anyone may request a written verification of their current certification status from the BACB for a $25 fee per verification. The verification letter is delivered as an emailed PDF document and contains the information shown on the registry.

**Would you like to give others the opportunity to contact you through the Certificant Registry?** Log into your BACB account, select Email Preferences, and indicate that you can be contacted.

## What does it mean now that I am certified?

Becoming certified means you have demonstrated that you have the knowledge and skills of an entry-level practicing behavior analyst. That said, consider what you are proficient in, what you know a little about (but need more experience and mentorship in), and what you do not know to ensure that you do not overstate your expertise to the public.

Consider your scope of competence (e.g., populations or behavior-analytic techniques you are capable of serving or using) because you have an ethical obligation to refrain from practicing outside of your scope of competence (see the Code).

## What steps should I take to begin my career as a professional?

The BACB cannot provide guidance on this outside of the requirements to maintain your certification, so the first step might be to identify a mentor who can help you develop a professional-development plan. That plan might include:

- Determining your scope of competence
- Recognizing skill sets that you need support with (e.g., billing) to move toward your goals
- Identifying ways to stay in contact with the literature (as a certificant, you have free access to recent issues of major behavior-analytic journals in your BACB account)
- Identifying ways to stay or get involved with the professional community, such as joining professional associations

A mentor might also be able to help you:

- Determine how to assess job opportunities to make sure they fit within your scope of competence and career goals
- Determine whether you are ready and qualified to serve as a supervisor, assessor, or trainer (see the Supervision, Assessment, Training and Oversight section)
- Determine whether a service organization has an environment that is set up to promote ethical behavior

# WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER PASSING THE EXAMINATION

## When can I start supervising?

**RBTs and BCaBAs:** You may start providing ongoing supervision to RBTs and BCaBAs as soon as you are certified and have met all other relevant supervision requirements (e.g., supervisor training). See the Ongoing Supervision sections in the RBT and BCaBA Handbooks for details.

**Trainees accruing fieldwork hours:** You may start providing supervision to trainees accruing fieldwork as soon as you are certified and have met all other relevant supervision requirements (e.g., supervisor training). Please note that during your first year of certification, you must meet with a consulting supervisor each month that you provide supervision to trainees accruing fieldwork. See the Consulting Supervisor Requirements for New BCBAs Supervising Fieldwork document for more information.

## How should I maintain my certification moving forward?

- Review the Certification Maintenance Requirements section and develop a plan to meet them, including accruing continuing education and complying with ethics requirements (e.g., ensure that you accept clients within the boundaries of your competence, have appropriate service contracts, provide appropriate services, follow procedures to ensure continuity of care and appropriate client transitions).

- Be sure to keep an eye out for helpful resources, like BACB videos, blogs, and podcasts. For example, the Tips for New Certificants blog shares valuable information for newly certified individuals, and The Professional Infrastructure of Applied Behavior Analysis video describes the various organizations in ABA.

- Keep your contact information up to date in your BACB account to ensure that you receive important updates about certification requirements, and periodically review bacb.com to stay informed of changes. This is especially important because if the BACB tries to contact you and receives no response after reasonable attempts are made, the BACB may take summary action (e.g., suspension) against your certification (see the Timely Responding to the BACB section).

- If your certification status is active, the BACB may contact you to request action and will expect a timely response. If you need to take a temporary break from maintaining your certification, review the inactive status policy.

- Report critical events to the BACB Ethics Department (see the Self-Reporting web page).

- Stay up to date with licensure requirements in your area.

- If your certification status changes (e.g., your certification becomes inactive), ensure that you accurately reflect your certification status to the public. For more information about the correct use of the BCBA certification mark, see the September 2008, October 2013, and July 2021 BACB Newsletters.

## Tips for Protecting Your BACB Information

The BACB works to ensure the security of our certificants' information. Despite our efforts, however, you are still at risk of someone misusing your credential, most commonly for billing fraud. Given the prevalence of open electronic access and digital identity theft, here are a few ways that you can take a proactive approach to maximizing the security of your professional credentials.

- **Check your BACB account regularly.** Put a reminder in your calendar to log in and check the accuracy of the information in your BACB account every six months or more frequently if you have been—or suspect you may be—the target of identity theft. It is critical that you log in to ensure that your information is accurate and review how your information is publicly displayed in the Certificant Registry. In addition to your personal information, review the information specific to supervisees or supervisors to make sure it is correct. If you find any inconsistencies or inaccuracies, use the Contact Us form to immediately inform us of the potential issue.

- **Protect your BACB certificate.** While your certification number is publicly available in the Certificant Registry, you should protect your BACB certificate from being copied and/or modified. Think twice before posting photos of your certificate on social media platforms, and be sure to keep your private BACB ID protected. This number is not published in the Certificant Registry and is generally only needed by your supervisees/trainees, the BACB, and certain funding sources.

- **If you suspect misuse of your information,** contact a specialist (e.g., attorney/advisor) in identity theft to help you determine your options. While BACB staff cannot provide legal advice, we are sympathetic to the frustrations you may experience if your information is misused. Finally, if you suspect the misuse or misappropriation of another certificant's credential (or the creation of false credentials), please immediately report your evidence to the appropriate authorities (e.g., law enforcement, funders) and to the BACB using the Reporting Infringement or Misuse Form.

For additional guidance, please refer to the August 2019 newsletter on our Newsletters web page.

## Continuing Education

Initial BCBA certification indicates that an individual has met entry-level standards of practice as a behavior analyst. The purpose of the BACB's continuing education (CE) requirement is to ensure that BCBA certificants engage in activities that will expand their behavior-analytic skills beyond the requirements for initial certification and help them stay up to date on developments in the profession.

### CEU Requirements

As a BCBA, you are required to obtain **32 continuing education units (CEUs)** within each 2-year recertification cycle, including:
- 4 CEUs in ethics
- 3 CEUs in supervision (for supervisors)

**Important Notes:**
- All CEUs must occur within the recertification cycle to which they are applied
- Example: If you submit your recertification application on September 27, 2021, and your recertification date is September 30, 2021, you may only count CEUs accrued from October 1, 2021, to September 30, 2023, toward your next recertification application
- You may not make up missed CEUs after your recertification date (i.e., during the reinstatement period)
- CEUs exceeding the required amount cannot be applied to the next cycle

Demonstrate that you meet this requirement by entering your CEUs into your BACB account as soon as you have supporting documentation.

## CEU Types

You can earn CEUs via three activity types. There are no restrictions or limitations on the number of non-repeating CEUs you can earn through each activity type. All CEU types are intended to ensure that certificants continue to engage in activities that expand their behavior-analytic skills.

| Continuing Education By | Documentation | CEU Values |
|---|---|---|
| **Learning** | | |
| Attending behavior-analytic learning events offered by Authorized Certificate Providers (ACE Providers) (see ACE Provider Verification Registry) | Certificate from the ACE Provider | 25 minutes of learning = 0.5 CEU |
| Completing didactic behavior-analytic graduate courses with a passing grade ("C" or higher in a graded course or "pass" in a pass/fail system)* | Syllabi and transcripts from university courses | 50 minutes of learning = 1 CEU |
| Participating in certain BACB certification activities | No documentation is needed for BACB events (these are issued directly into BACB accounts) | — |
| **Teaching** | | |
| Single instruction session for a Learning CE event | Documentation from the ACE Provider for the duration of time the instructor presented a Learning event | 25 minutes of instruction = 0.5 CEU |
| Teaching university courses in behavior analysis at an accredited, degree-granting university* | Letter from a department chair indicating that the certificant taught a university course | 50 minutes of instruction = 1 CEU |
| **Scholarship** | | |
| Publishing an article on behavior analysis in a peer-reviewed journal | A PDF of the final published article | 1 publication = 8 CEUs |
| Writing a review or decision letter for an article on behavior analysis submitted to a peer-reviewed journal | Confirmation from the journal (e.g., confirmation email, snapshot of the account), associate editor, or editor. Note: Please redact title and author information. | 1 review/decision letter = 1 CEU |

*For the purpose of establishing instructional requirements that can be applied globally, 1 semester credit hour will represent 15 hours of classroom instruction, and 1 quarter credit hour will represent 10 hours of classroom instruction. This conversion is based on US Federal Rule.

---

## CEU Content

Continuing education may address any aspect of behavior analysis: practice, science, methodology, theory, or the profession. CEUs must cover material that goes beyond the current BCBA/BCaBA Task List and coursework required to sit for the certification examinations.

### Ethics CEU

Ethics continuing education is defined as (a) events related to the BACB's ethics requirements and/or (b) events related to cultural/contextual responsiveness. The content must relate to behavior-analytic practice or applied research and be directly linked to the behavior-analytic literature and/or established practice. To qualify as Ethics continuing education, most of the content must focus on ethics.

**Note:** There are a lot of options for continuing education in terms of format, content, and providers, among others. Consider obtaining CEUs that will help with your professional development plan. And remember that the intent is for ongoing development.

# Continuing Education Requirements

## Applied Research and Literature

Applied research must be directly linked to behavior-analytic intent for ongoing literature and/or established practice. To qualify as Ethics continuing education, most of the event must focus on ethics or cultural/contextual responsiveness. Continuing education events that only briefly reference the BACB's ethics codes and primarily cover unrelated content should not be offered as Ethics continuing education.

The BACB's intent is for ongoing development, so continuing education throughout your recertification cycle is highly recommended.

## Continuing Education Methods

| | Continuing Education By: | Documentation | CEU Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Learning** | Attending behavior-analytic learning events offered by Authorized Continuing Education (ACE) Providers (see ACE Provider Verification Registry) | Certificate from the ACE Provider | 25 minutes of learning = 0.5 CEU (i.e., 50 minutes of learning = 1 CEU) |
| | Completing didactic behavior-analytic graduate courses with a passing grade ("C" or higher in a graded course or "pass" in a pass/fail system)* | Syllabi and transcripts from university courses | |
| | Participating in certain BACB certification activities | No documentation is needed for BACB events (these are issued directly into BACB accounts) | |
| **Teaching** | Single instruction session for a Learning CE event | Documentation from the ACE Provider for the duration of time the instructor presented a Learning event | 25 minutes of instruction = 0.5 CEU (i.e., 50 minutes of instruction = 1 CEU) |
| | Teaching university courses in behavior analysis at an accredited, degree-granting university* | Letter from a department chair indicating that the certificant taught a university course | |
| **Scholarship** | Publishing an article on behavior analysis in a peer-reviewed journal | A PDF of the final published article | 1 publication = 8 CEUs |
| | Writing a review or decision letter for an article on behavior analysis submitted to a peer-reviewed journal | Confirmation from the journal (e.g., confirmation email, snapshot of the account), associate editor, or editor. Note: Please redact title and author information. | 1 review/decision letter = 1 CEU |

# Certification Maintenance Requirements

## Supervision CEUs

BCBAs who have supervised the ongoing practice of RBTs or BCaBAs on record or trainees pursuing BCBA or BCaBA certification at any point during their recertification cycle must obtain and enter 3 supervision CEUs to recertify. Supervision is behavior analytic in nature and covers effective supervision as described in the BACB Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline (2.0) and the Nature of Supervision section.

## Ethics/Supervision CEU Overlap

A CEU may be counted as either an ethics CEU or a supervision CEU, but not both. CEUs acquired from the 8-hour supervision training may count as supervision CEUs only.

## Repeating CE Activities

Repeating CE activities of any CEU type does not provide new or expanded knowledge or skills and, therefore, does not meet BACB certification requirements.

## Complaints About Continuing Education Events

As a participant in an ACE event, certificants must be provided with information about the complaint process by the ACE Provider, including how to contact the ACE Coordinator regarding concerns.

All complaints from attendees of ACE events, including those regarding potential ACE event requirement violations, must first be directed to the ACE Coordinator in writing. If a complaint cannot be resolved with the coordinator, the participant may submit an NAV against the ACE Coordinator.

# Ethics and Self-Reporting

You must adhere to the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts and self-reporting requirements. The BACB is prohibited from providing any legal advice and from interpreting any ethics requirements.

## Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts (Code)

The Code contains six sections outlining candidates' and certificants' responsibilities related to professional conduct, clients and service provisions, supervision, and colleagues. Certificants are required to remain knowledgeable about the Code. Those supervising others (i.e., trainees, RBTs, BCaBAs) must ensure that they review and address the Code (and the RBT Ethics Code [2.0] where applicable) with their supervisees or trainees.

Certificants should also endeavor to address potential violations directly with the relevant individual if appropriate. When considering whether submitting a Notice of Alleged Violation is appropriate, certificants should consult the Considerations for Reporting an Alleged Violation Against a BCaBA/BCBA or the Considerations for Reporting an Alleged Violation Against an RBT document.

# Certification Maintenance Requirements

## Self-Reporting

Per the BACB's ethics requirements, applicants and certificants must self-report to the BACB any personal or professional conduct, condition, or event that may pose a risk to others or reasonably impact their ability to safely or competently practice. These events may relate to their roles as service providers, supervisors, educators, trainers, or business owners or managers of any organization or company that provides behavior-analytic services, supervision, education, and/or training.

For further guidance on when to self-report, please review the information on the Self-Reporting web page. Visit the Ethics web page for information about code-enforcement procedures, ethics resources, and more.

### Changes to Personal Information

You are required to keep the personal information in your BACB account up to date, including your address, email address, and legal name. Please change or correct any outdated information within 30 days of the change or of becoming aware of the outdated information.

Please note that name changes will require the submission of government-issued documentation reflecting your previous and current name, and address changes may require the submission of documentation that verifies your residence.

### Noncompliance with BACB-Required Supervision

BCBAs, BCaBA Supervisors, RBTs, RBT Supervisors, and RBT Requirements Coordinators, among others, are required to self-report any supervision noncompliance to the BACB in a timely manner.

### Critical Events

The following events must be self-reported to the BACB in a timely manner (no more than 30 days after becoming aware of the event). This guidance does not constitute ethics or legal advice. If it is not required that you self-report your situation to the BACB, but you are still unsure, the best course of action is to self-report.

For the purposes of self-reporting, funder refers to any entity (e.g., healthcare organization, state or federally funded service, commercial payer, managed care organization, educational institution, other payment entity) that you have contracted with to provide behavior-analytic, educational, or health-care services.

#### Violations of Ethics Standards

You must self-report any violation of one or more standards in the applicable BACB ethics code (i.e., Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts for BCBAs and BCaBAs, RBT Ethics Code [2.0] for RBTs). This includes, but is not limited to, the following events:

# Certification Maintenance Requirements

## Recertification

As a BCBA, you are required to submit a recertification application (including payment) every two years.

Recertification applications are available in your BACB account within 45 days of your recertification date. You must complete your recertification application on or before your recertification date to avoid lapses in your certification and late fees. Please note that submission of your application will only be allowed once you have entered enough CEUs in your account. You may navigate away from your recertification application to the CE tab to add or make changes to your CEUs.

## Recertifying

1. **Throughout your certification cycle, enter your CEUs into your BACB account.** All CEUs must be completed and entered into your BACB account before your recertification date. If you supervised the ongoing practice of one or more RBTs or BCaBAs on record at any point during your recertification cycle, you must have obtained and entered 3 supervision CEUs to recertify.
   
   Note: All CEUs must include CEU documentation to support each entry. Entries used to fulfill a CE category must clearly indicate the number of CEUs for that specific category (i.e., general, supervision, ethics) in the documentation. Copies of CEU documentation will not be provided to the certificant. Please see the Documentation Policy for more information.

2. **As soon as all of your CEUs are entered AND you are within 45 days of your recertification date,** a recertification application will appear in your BACB account under the Recertification tab. This tab will not be visible until these two elements are met.

3. **Complete the application and pay the fee.** Make sure that you are reviewing your information closely in your recertification application to ensure that it is accurate, including your contact information and mailing address.
   
   Note: At the time of application, you will be asked to attest to questions in the Eligibility Affidavit section of the application and agree to the Application Processing Agreement. You will be asked to affirm that you have read, are in compliance with, and will continue to comply with all BACB requirements. You must disclose whether you have a physical or mental health condition, or a substance use disorder, that could impair your ability to safely and competently work as a BCBA. You must also report if you have been subject to certain types of investigations or disciplinary actions, or if you have been subject to official actions related to behavior analysis services or public safety. Please read the question carefully and answer truthfully.
   
   Answering "yes" to the question will require you to complete and submit an Ethics Self-Reporting Form. Your application will be placed on hold while your self-report is reviewed by BACB staff.

4. **If your CEU entries are selected for audit,** we might reach out for additional action via email. If we do not receive the appropriate documentation (e.g., incorrect and/or duplicate documentation, lack of ethics or supervision documentation), to indicate that you met the CE requirements, your certification will expire.

## If Your Application Has Been Approved

- Your certification dates will update with a new expiration date that is two years from your last recertification date.
- After your new recertification date, you may start accruing CEUs for your next recertification cycle. Even if you complete the recertification application before your recertification date, you can only count CEUs for your next cycle once that new cycle starts.
- You will receive a new certificate in the mail at the address on record within 4–6 weeks.

## If You Do Not Recertify

- **By your recertification date:** Your certification status will become inactive, and you will not be permitted to bill, practice, supervise, or represent yourself as a BCBA. If you complete all of your CE requirements but fail to recertify before your recertification date, you will have 30 days from your recertification date to reinstate your certification and pay the late fee. Additional CEUs may not be accrued during the reinstatement period. After this reinstatement period, you will lose your certification and will need to reapply and meet the eligibility requirements applicable at that time.

# CERTIFICATION MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS

## Reinstatement Period

By the end of your reinstatement period, your certification will expire, and you will not be permitted to bill, practice, supervise, or represent yourself as a BCBA. You will need to reapply and meet the eligibility requirements applicable at that time to become a BCBA.

## Guidance for Those Who Missed Their Recertification Date and Wish to Remain Certified

### MISSED MY DATE - I missed my recertification date. What should I do?

You must stop using your BCBA certification immediately.

**Decision Tree:**

1. Did you complete all of your CEUs by your recertification date?
   - **YES** → Log in to your BACB account and complete the recertification application
   - **NO** → Has it been 30* days or less since your recertification date?
     - **YES** → Complete an application for certification inactive
     - **NO** → Has it been 5 years or less since your certification expired?
       - **YES** → Complete an application to qualify for an examination via past certification
       - **NO** → Review current requirements and complete a new application for certification

*Starting January 1, 2024, BCBAs will have 30 days from their recertification date to reinstate their certification and pay the late fee.

## Recertification Fees

| Fee Type | BCBA | BCBA-D |
|----------|------|--------|
| Recertification Application | $215 | $290 |
| Late Fee | $50 | $50 |
| Insufficient Funds/Returned Check | $45 | $45 |

**Note:** BACB fees are nonrefundable and nontransferable. The BACB only accepts US currency. Please do not send cash.

## Inactive Policy

BCBAs may become inactive because:

- they placed their certification on voluntary inactive status or active duty/reserve status,
- they did not recertify by their recertification date, or
- they have sanctions against their certification.

BCBAs with an inactive certification may not bill, practice, supervise, or represent themselves as active BCBAs.

## Voluntary Inactive Status

BCBAs who need a break from maintaining their certification for a period—and who are within their recertification cycle and have completed continuing education for their recertification cycle (prorated to the month)—may request inactive status. As an inactive BCBA, you are not permitted to practice, bill, supervise, or represent yourself as an active BCBA, and you will be listed as inactive on the Certificant Registry.

Once granted voluntary inactive status, you may remain inactive for up to four years. There are no certification maintenance requirements (e.g., recertification fees) during the period of inactivity.

### Applying for Voluntary Inactive Status

If you wish to request voluntary inactive status, you must complete the BCBA Application for Voluntary Inactive Status and pay a one-time, inactive-request fee of $50.

Requirements:

- You may not apply for voluntary inactive status while you are in your reinstatement period
- You must be in an active certification cycle
- You must have completed continuing education requirements prorated based on the number of months in the current certification cycle

#### Example: How Your Recertification Cycle is Paused While on Voluntary Inactive Status

If you go on inactive status 18 months into your recertification cycle, you will have needed to complete 24 CEUs. When you return, you will need to accrue the remaining CEUs for the next 6 months of your cycle before your next recertification date. Your next recertification date will be 6 months from the date that you return from inactive status.

### Applying for Return From Voluntary Inactive Status

If you are on voluntary inactive status for less than 4 years and wish to reactivate your certification, you must submit a BCBA/BCaBA Request to Return from Voluntary Inactive Status Application.

If you are on voluntary inactive status for 2 to 4 years, you must obtain and submit documentation of 8 CEUs along with the application. These CEUs will not count toward your recertification cycle.

Once your certification has been reactivated, your recertification cycle will resume. You may not apply for voluntary inactive status again until your next recertification cycle.

#### Expiration if Not Reactivated Within 4 Years

If you do not apply for reactivation within 4 years, your certification will expire as of the date it would have expired had you not gone on voluntary inactive status.

**Example:** If your certification cycle was from September 30, 2025, to September 29, 2027, and you went on voluntary inactive status on December 1, 2025, you would need to apply to return by December 1, 2029. If you do not, your certification will show as expired as of September 29, 2027.

If you wish to become certified again, you must reapply for certification under the eligibility requirements in place at that time. Please note that new BACB certifications are not available to individuals who reside outside of BACB jurisdiction, including those who qualify via the past certification option.

# Certification Maintenance Requirements

## Active Duty/Reserve Status

If you are called to active military duty in the armed forces and are actively certified, you may apply for a temporary pause of your recertification cycle to cover the time frame for which you are called (not to exceed two years). While on reserve inactive status, you are prohibited from representing yourself as an active BCBA. This policy only applies to service members just joining the military or those being deployed. If a spouse of a service member wishes to go on inactive status, they must apply for voluntary inactive status.

If you are called to active military duty in the armed forces and have an active examination authorization, please see the Compassionate Appeals criteria.

### Applying for Active Duty/Reserve Status

Upon being called to active duty, notify the BACB via the Contact Us Form and provide a copy of your official call-up notice. The BACB will place your certification on inactive status during your active duty period. Following completion of your active duty or two years, whichever is earlier, you must contact the BACB to update your certification status.

When your certification becomes active again, your recertification cycle will resume.

### Fees

| Inactive Status Fees | Amount |
|---|---|
| BCBA Application for Voluntary Inactive Status | $50 |
| BCBA/BCaBA Request to Return from Voluntary Inactive Status Application (0–2 years inactive) | $0 |
| BCBA/BCaBA Request to Return from Voluntary Inactive Status Application (2–4 years inactive) | $50 |
| Active Duty/Reserve Status | $0 |

*BACB fees are nonrefundable and nontransferable. The BACB only accepts US currency. Please do not send cash.*

# Supervision, Assessment, Training, and Oversight

## Supervision, Assessment, Training, and Oversight

As a BCBA, you may serve in the important role of overseeing the work, training, or assessment of others who are providing behavior-analytic services or working toward BACB certification. This oversight may occur in three primary roles:

### Primary Roles

- **Supervisor**: As a supervisor, you will oversee those who are providing behavior-analytic services (i.e., RBTs, BCaBAs) and/or those who are accruing fieldwork hours toward becoming certified (i.e., trainees). Note: In overseeing RBTs, you may also be an RBT Requirements Coordinator who is responsible for ensuring that multiple supervisors in an organization are providing appropriate supervision to RBTs (see the Ongoing Supervision section of the RBT Handbook for more details).

- **Attestor**: As an attestor, you will be responsible for confirming that the age, education, background check, and abuse registry check meet the BACB requirements for individuals pursuing RBT certification.

- **Assessor**: As an assessor, you will be responsible for directly conducting or overseeing assessments of those pursuing RBT certification or those who are maintaining their RBT certification to determine whether they are competent in specific tasks commonly conducted by behavior technicians (i.e., Certification Application Competency Assessment or Recertification Application Competency Assessment).

- **Trainer**: As a trainer, you will develop and/or provide the RBT 40-hour training and/or oversee individuals who are providing the RBT 40-hour training.

### Eligibility for Supervision

Eligible supervisors who meet the supervision requirements are identified in the BACB Certificant Registry with the statement "Completed supervision training on DATE." The date shown is the date the certificant became eligible to provide supervision.

### Compliance and Ethics

Because of the obvious importance of these roles, failure to comply with BACB requirements and ethics standards constitutes a violation of the Code and may result in a Notice of Alleged Violation being filed against you and subsequent action being taken by the Ethics Department.

This section of the handbook provides an overview of each role; however, you will need to carefully review the linked requirements specified in each section. It is the responsibility of every candidate, certificant, and supervisor to ensure that any supervision provided or received is consistent with current BACB requirements, any applicable state regulatory requirements (e.g., licensure), and relevant third-party payer requirements.

### Overview of Additional Requirements by Role

Although holding BCBA certification is the primary qualification, additional requirements are indicated in the following table:

| Role | Ongoing Supervision | 8-Hour Supervision Training* | CEUs in Supervision | May Not Be Related to, Subordinate to, or Employed by the Trainee, Supervisee, or Certificant |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Attesting RBTs | × | × | ✓ | × |
| Assessing RBTs (competency assessments) | ✓ | × | ✓ | × |
| Training RBTs (RBT 40-hour training) | ✓ | × | ✓ | × |
| Supervising RBTs | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | × |
| Supervising BCBA and BCaBA trainees in your first year of certification | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Supervising BCBA and BCaBA trainees after your first year of certification | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | × |
| Supervising BCaBAs | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | × |

*You can find a list of ACE Providers who may offer 8-hour supervision training on the ACE Provider Directory.*

# Supervision, Assessment, Training, and Oversight

## Attesting, Assessing, Training, and Supervising RBTs

### Attesting RBTs (Age, Education, Background, and Abuse Registry Check)

As of January 2, 2025, the RBT Certification Application Attestation form is used to confirm that the Age, Education, Background, and Abuse Registry Check eligibility requirements have been met. A qualified attestor confirms that these eligibility requirements have been met. Please note that if you are attesting based on the information the organization's Human Resources provides, then it is your responsibility to be familiar with the organization's policies, procedures, and processes when vetting applicants for the RBT certification.

**Reference Documents:** RBT Certification Application Attestation form

### Assessing RBTs (Competency Assessments)

One of the primary eligibility and maintenance requirements for RBT certification is demonstrating competence in the tasks on the Certification/Recertification Application Competency Assessment. A qualified assessor conducts these assessments and, in some cases, may also involve and oversee assistant assessors.

**Requirements:** The 2026 Initial Competency Assessment and the Recertification Competency Assessment include the requirements for administering the assessments.

**Reference Documents:**
- 2026 Initial Competency Assessment
- Recertification Competency Assessment

### Training RBTs (RBT 40-Hour Training)

As one of the requirements to obtain certification, RBT applicants must complete a 40-hour training based on the RBT Task List (2nd ed.). A qualified trainer conducts the training and, in some cases, may also involve and oversee assistant trainers.

**Requirements:** The RBT 2026 40-Hour Training Requirements and Curriculum Outline describes the requirements for conducting the RBT 40-hour training.

**Reference Documents:**
- RBT 2026 40-Hour Training Requirements and Curriculum Outline

### Supervising RBTs

RBTs practice under the close, ongoing supervision of an RBT Supervisor and/or an RBT Requirements Coordinator who is responsible for the RBT's work (see the Ongoing Supervision section of the RBT Handbook for a full description of each role's requirements).

**Requirements:** The Ongoing Supervision section of the RBT Handbook helps RBT Supervisors, RBT Requirements Coordinators, and RBTs ensure that the appropriate ongoing supervision is provided in order to maintain active certification.

**Reference Documents:** RBT Handbook

# Supervision, Assessment, Training, and Oversight

## Managing Alleged Ethics Violations by RBTs

As an RBT Supervisor, you are responsible for the actions of all RBTs under your supervision, so it's important to be aware of the special considerations for submitting a Notice of Alleged Violation against an RBT. You can learn more about these considerations by visiting the Reporting Alleged Violations Against RBTs web page and by reviewing the Considerations for Reporting an Alleged Violation Against an RBT document.

Supervisors are often best positioned to immediately and directly address some ethics violations by an RBT. Therefore, in an instance where an RBT Requirements Coordinator or RBT Supervisor becomes aware of a potential ethics violation by an RBT, they must take steps to investigate and document the alleged violation. If they determine that a violation did occur, they should decide if the matter should be addressed internally or by submitting a Notice of Alleged Violation to the BACB.

### When to Submit a Notice of Alleged Violation

Submit a Notice of Alleged Violation against the RBT if the alleged violation:

- involves abuse or neglect of a client;
- results in the RBT being charged with or convicted of a violation of the law;
- is a violation of standard 1.03, 1.05, 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, or 3.05 of the RBT Ethics Code (2.0); OR
- has occurred repeatedly despite reasonable attempts to address the problem with the RBT.

### Internal Resolution

If none of these situations apply, the RBT Requirements Coordinator and/or RBT Supervisor should develop and implement an individualized corrective-action plan for the RBT and document the outcome. The BACB reserves the right to audit the RBT Requirements Coordinator or RBT Supervisor for documentation of the complaint, investigation, and resolution.

## Tips for Supervising Trainees, RBTs, or BCaBAs

Being a supervisor is an important responsibility in both shaping future behavior analysts and helping to facilitate quality services being provided to clients. With that in mind, here are a few tips for those who supervise.

### Know the Relevant Supervision Requirements

This might be obvious by now, but supervisors should know the relevant requirements for supervision and stay up to date about requirements changes by reading the BACB Newsletter and periodically reviewing the BACB website and BCBA Handbook.

It's also vital to remember that the BACB reserves the right to contact you to share or request information regarding individuals for whom you are or were the supervisor on record. For example, if your RBT or BCaBA supervisee is named in a Notice of Alleged Violation, they must immediately notify you, share all documentation they received from the BACB, and review it with you.

### Become Intimately Familiar with the BACB's Ethics Codes

Supervisors should know the Code and, if relevant, the RBT Ethics Code (2.0). In addition to following the Code in your practice and supervision, you must be an ethical resource and guide for your supervisees/trainees (see the A Summary of Ethics Violations and Code-Enforcement Activities document for the most recent ethics data).

It is important to review the Responsibility to Supervisees and Trainees section of the Code carefully and take those standards into account when determining how you will provide supervision. For instance, when determining how many supervisees you can supervise, consider:

- the number of clients on your caseload;
- how many hours each supervisee currently works;
- the amount of time required for their supervision;
- the clients' needs; and
- the program settings, among others.

Please note that planning for transitions when discontinuing supervision is crucial, as abruptly ending supervision—particularly for ongoing cases involving RBTs and BCaBAs—can negatively impact services. Ensure you have transition plans in place to minimize these impacts.

It's also vital to remember that the BACB reserves the right to contact you to share or request information regarding individuals for whom you are or were the supervisor on record. For example, if your RBT supervisee is named in a Notice of Alleged Violation, they must immediately notify you, share all documentation they received from the BACB, and review it with you. If applicable, you will also receive the Notice of Alleged Violation and the Disciplinary Determination and Appeal Determination from the BACB Ethics Department.

# Supervision, Assessment, Training, and Oversight

## Appeal Determination

From the BACB Ethics Department.

## Getting Started as a Supervisor

- Consider whether you are ready to be a supervisor. We highly recommend waiting until after you have ample experiences of your own before you supervise others. In addition, consider whether supervision activities will be within your area of defined competence and whether you have the time and ability to supervise trainees. As a reminder, if you are a first-year BCBA who provides supervision to BCBA and BCaBA trainees accruing fieldwork, you must meet with a consulting supervisor each month in which you provide supervision for the remainder of your first year.

- Determine whether your trainee is pursuing or maintaining more than one credential. If so, you will need to ensure that all requirements are being met and separately documented for each credential that you are overseeing.

- Develop your time management and organizational systems. Have these systems in place before you start supervision to ensure that you are meeting all relevant requirements. For example, you will need a system for keeping your RBT and BCaBA supervisee accounts up to date with the BACB, documenting feedback, and evaluating the effects of your supervision, among other areas. In the event of an audit, it is your responsibility to produce the requested documentation. For additional guidance, use these optional supervision checklists:
  - Supervision Checklist for RBT Supervisors
  - RBT Requirements and Coordinators

- Evaluate fit before agreeing to supervise. Identify your work and supervision style before taking on a supervisee/trainee to determine whether their style is a good fit. Both you and the trainee/supervisee have a history of experiences coming into the relationship, so it is helpful to know a little about them before agreeing to be their supervisor. If your styles don't fit, determine whether you are open to adjusting your supervision style.

- Set clear expectations. Although a supervision contract is only required for supervising trainees and BCaBAs—not RBTs—setting clear expectations at the beginning of supervision is valuable in all supervisory relationships.

- Aim to provide high-quality, individualized, and effective supervision. Don't just focus on doing enough to meet the BACB's requirements. These were established as minimum requirements that allow flexibility for variations in each setting. Think about what your past supervisors have done well (and maybe not so well) so that you can identify how you can provide high-quality supervision. For instance, you may want to develop a supervision curriculum for the trainee/supervisee that includes behavior-analytic topics, specific skills that are important in practice (e.g., problem solving, interpersonal skills), and skills that they will need when they become a supervisor (see the Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline [2.0]).

- Continue your professional development as a supervisor and seek out a trusted mentor. These tips are only a starting point. There is growing literature on supervision, as well as continuing education events and resources on the topic, so make continued growth and learning part of your regular schedule.

## Supervising BCBA and BCaBA Trainees

To obtain BCBA and BCaBA certification, individuals must complete a defined practical experience in applied behavior analysis under the supervision of a qualified supervisor.

**Requirements:** Supervisors must provide supervision in accordance with the BCBA or BCaBA fieldwork requirements.

## Supervising BCaBAs

BCaBA certificants may not practice independently, so they must practice under the supervision of a qualified supervisor.

**Requirements:** The Ongoing Supervision section of the BCaBA Handbook helps both supervisors and BCaBAs ensure that the appropriate ongoing supervision is provided in order to maintain certification.

# BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYST-DOCTORAL

## Board Certified Behavior Analyst-Doctoral (BCBA-D)

BCBAs with doctoral training in behavior analysis may apply for the designation of Board Certified Behavior Analyst-Doctoral (BCBA-D). The BCBA-D is not a separate certification and does not grant any privileges beyond the BCBA certification. If you hold the BCBA-D designation, you function in the same capacity as a BCBA (i.e., as an independent practitioner who provides behavior-analytic services) and are required to meet all BCBA maintenance requirements.

## BCBA-D Eligibility Requirements

If you wish to become a BCBA-D, you must be actively certified as a BCBA and meet one of the following options.

### Option A: Accredited Doctoral Program

**ACTIVE BCBA CERTIFICATION + DOCTORAL DEGREE FROM ABAI-ACCREDITED PROGRAM = BCBA-D**

**Doctoral Degree From an ABAI-Accredited Program:** You hold a doctoral degree from a doctoral program accredited by the Association for Behavior Analysis International.

Demonstrate that you meet this requirement when you apply by submitting an official transcript listing a doctoral degree that was conferred by an ABAI-accredited doctoral program.

### Option B: Nonaccredited Doctoral Program

**ACTIVE BCBA CERTIFICATION + DOCTORAL COURSEWORK OR MENTORSHIP OR PUBLICATIONS + DOCTORAL DEGREE WITH BEHAVIOR-ANALYTIC DISSERTATION = BCBA-D**

**Doctoral Degree with a Behavior-Analytic Dissertation:** You hold a doctoral degree from a qualifying institution, conducted a behavior-analytic dissertation, AND meet ONE of the following additional requirements:

• **Doctoral Coursework:** You passed at least four behavior-analytic courses as part of your doctoral program of study.

OR

• **Mentorship:** You received formal mentorship from a faculty member who, at the time of your mentorship, held the BCBA credential and had completed an 8-hour supervision training prior to beginning the mentorship relationship.

OR

• **Publications:** You authored two published peer-reviewed journal articles that are behavior analytic in nature. These articles may have been published before, during, or after conferral of your doctoral degree. These publications do not need to be experimental in nature, and first authorship is not required.

**Demonstrate that you meet this requirement when you apply by submitting:**

• A copy of an official transcript from the institution showing a conferred doctoral degree;

• A copy of the published (e.g., in ProQuest) dissertation abstract; AND

• One of the following:

  - **If applying with doctoral coursework:** A copy of the official doctoral program of study showing all required courses, along with four syllabi from those courses, to demonstrate that they were entirely behavior-analytic in nature.

  - **If applying with mentorship:** A letter on university letterhead that attests to the formal mentorship relationship from the faculty member who held a BCBA certification and completed an 8-hour supervision training; OR

  - **If applying with publications:** Copies of two journal articles.

> Please note that your full dissertation may also be requested as part of your application review if we are unable to determine whether it meets the behavior-analytic requirement based on the abstract.

### Option C: Postdoctoral Respecialization

**ACTIVE BCBA CERTIFICATION + DOCTORAL DEGREE + POSTDOCTORAL EXPERIENCE + PUBLICATIONS = BCBA-D**

**Doctoral Degree:** You hold a doctoral degree from a qualifying institution.

AND

**Postdoctoral Experience:** You accumulated a minimum of 1,800 hours (beyond the experience hours used to qualify for BCBA certification) in applied behavior analysis during a postdoctoral fellowship or postdoctoral employment experience, which included explicit, ongoing education in behavior analysis conducted under the supervision of a BCBA who met the supervision requirements in place at that time.

AND

**Publications:** You authored two peer-reviewed journal articles that (a) are behavior analytic in nature and (b) were completed as a product of the training experience described earlier. These publications do not need to be experimental in nature, and first authorship is not required.

**Demonstrate that you meet this requirement when you apply by submitting** a copy of an official transcript showing a conferred doctoral degree, a letter of attestation from the BCBA who supervised the 1,800 hours of postdoctoral experience/fellowship, and copies of your publications.

The supervising BCBA may determine how the ongoing experience is documented.

# Other Relevant Policies

## Administrative Appeals

The BACB offers three types of administrative appeals: application, examination, and compassionate.

Appeals submitted to the BACB are reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Committee. Only one (1) type of administrative appeal may be requested for any specific matter or event. Once an administrative appeal has been reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Committee and a determination has been made, no further review of the specific matter or event that was the subject to the administrative appeal will be available from the Committee or the BACB. Appeals decisions are final and may not be further reviewed or appealed.

**Note:** BACB standards, requirements, deadlines, procedures, fees, examination content, examination editions, examination delivery modality, examination results, and examination-specific questions/answers may not be appealed.

### Application Appeals

Adverse BACB decisions including, but not limited to, the denial of a certification, renewal, recertification, or other applications submitted to the BACB may be appealed if:

- (a) you have sufficient evidence to support that you properly completed and submitted all of the required documentation to the BACB by the deadline,
- (b) you were given incorrect feedback or guidance from the BACB, or
- (c) you experienced a technical issue with your BACB account that prevented you from meeting the deadline.

This type of appeal applies to all trainees, applicants, certificants, and Authorized Continuing Education (ACE) Providers.

#### The following may not be appealed:

- BACB standards
- Requirements
- Deadlines
- Procedures
- Fees
- Examination content
- Examination edition
- Examination delivery modality
- Examination results
- Specific questions/answers

Do not submit an appeal in order to request information about a denied application; you will receive detailed information (i.e., reasons for the application denial, steps that must be taken to correct any deficiencies) at the time of the denial. To request information about a denied application, please use the Contact Us Form. If you have an active application and must submit additional or corrected documentation, please follow the instructions in your application determination.

#### How to appeal:

You must file a written request for an appeal within 30 days of the determination by completing the Administrative Appeal Request Form. You must include evidence with your submission to support your appeal request.

### Examination Appeals

If you experience examination condition irregularities (e.g., poor lighting, disruptive noises, long screen-load times) during your examination, you may file an appeal with the BACB.

**Note:** Pearson VUE sites deliver BACB examinations via a web browser, so minor Internet bandwidth variances are to be expected. BACB standards, requirements, deadlines, procedures, fees, examination content, examination delivery modality, examination results, and specific questions/answers may not be appealed.

#### How to appeal:

You must file a written request for appeal within 7 days of your examination appointment by completing the Administrative Appeal Request Form.

### Compassionate Appeals

If you have experienced a qualifying unforeseen life event or extenuating circumstance that warrants relief (e.g., hospitalization, act of nature) within 1 year before the determination that you wish to appeal (e.g., the day that your certification expires), you may submit an appeal request. This type of appeal applies to all trainees, applicants, candidates, certificants, and ACE Providers who have supporting evidence that a qualifying life event occurred.

BACB staff will evaluate the appeal based on:

- The date of the event
- Its potential impact on your ability to obtain or maintain BACB certification
- The amount of time you had to meet the applicable requirements (e.g., whether you are using the 2 years between recertification to accrue continuing education)
- Whether you could have taken preventative actions (e.g., applied for voluntary inactive status)

#### How to appeal:

You must file a written request for an appeal within 6 months of the determination by completing the Administrative Appeal Request Form. This appeal request requires documentation that verifies the event or circumstance in question.

## Name Change Policy

Depending on where you are in the certification process, submitting a Name Change Request may be necessary for any of the following reasons:

- Your name has changed since creating a BACB account.
- Your name does not match your ID.
- You are notifying of a former name for application documents.

To submit a Name Change Request, log into your BACB account, select Update Profile, select the option that best applies to your circumstances, and follow the instructions that will be sent to you via email, including submitting official documentation verifying your name change.

## Acceptable Signatures Policy

The BACB accepts electronic signatures for applications and forms, whether submitted electronically or by mail. Although it is preferred that documents are digitally signed using a third-party electronic signature service (e.g., Adobe Sign, DocuSign, HelloSign), the BACB will accept any type of electronic signature (e.g., Adobe Fill & Sign, JPEG of a signature), provided the document is signed by the appropriate party with the intent of signing the document.

The BACB also accepts handwritten signatures on scanned documents, unless the document states that an electronic signature is required.

# Documentation and Signature Requirements

Documents submitted to the BACB must be signed by the appropriate party with the intent of signing the document.

The BACB accepts handwritten signatures on scanned documents, unless the document states that an original signed copy is needed. Alterations on documents (e.g., white-outs, strikethroughs) must be initialed by all relevant parties.

## Electronic and Digital Signatures

An electronic signature is "an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record" (15 U.S.C. § 7006 (2000)). Simply stated, an electronic signature is an electronic expression indicating a signee's intent to sign a document. By contrast, a digital signature is a specific kind of electronic signature, which requires authentication of a signee's identity.

# Other Relevant Policies

## Documentation Policy

All documentation submitted to the BACB, for any reason, becomes the property of the BACB. Documents submitted to the BACB will be retained and/or safely discarded at the discretion of the BACB. For this reason, candidates should retain a copy of their certification application and all supporting documentation for their personal records and to be prepared for future applications. The BACB will not return documentation to applicants or certificants.

## Submission of False, Forged, or Untrue Information to the BACB

The BACB reserves the right to invalidate any certification (immediately making the certification null and void) and/or prohibit any individual from taking a BACB examination if the individual submitted false, forged, or untrue information.

Examples of false, forged, or untrue information include:

* Submitting false, inconsistent, or misleading statements or omitting information the BACB requests
* Submitting an altered or inauthentic transcript
* Submitting an application containing false, inconsistent, or misleading information
* Submitting documentation that misrepresents your current address and/or country of residence to become eligible for certification
* Attempting to take the examination for someone else or having someone else take the examination for you
* Copying or sharing information or any other form of cheating
* Obtaining advanced access to certification or examination material
* Stealing examination materials
* Bringing prohibited items into the examination room
* Failing to follow directions from testing-center staff
* Violating Pearson VUE scheduling or testing-center rules and regulations

## Timely Responding to the BACB

If an individual fails to respond to the BACB after reasonable contact attempts are made, or if an individual fails to comply with a request from the BACB, the BACB may take summary action (e.g., suspension) against their eligibility or certification. See the Code-Enforcement Procedures document for more information.

# Glossary

## ABAI Accreditation
A formal recognition given by the Accreditation Board of the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) to postsecondary behavior-analytic programs that meet specific academic and quality standards designed to prepare graduates for professional practice.

## APBA Accreditation
A formal recognition given by the Accreditation Board of the Association of Professional Behavior Analysts (APBA) to master's-level academic programs in applied behavior analysis (ABA) that meet specific academic and quality standards designed to prepare graduates for professional practice.

## Applicant
An individual who is pursuing certification.

## BCBA-Doctoral
BCBAs with doctoral training in behavior analysis may receive the designation of Board Certified Behavior Analyst-Doctoral® (BCBA-D®). The BCBA-D is not a separate certification and it does not grant any privileges above or beyond the BCBA certification. If you are certified at the BCBA-D level, you function in the same capacity as a BCBA (i.e., as an independent practitioner who provides behavior-analytic services) and are required to meet all BCBA maintenance requirements. Information that pertains to BCBAs also pertains to BCBA-Ds (e.g., supervisor qualifications).

## Behavior-Analytic Dissertation
The dissertation must include at least one experimental manipulation. The independent variable must be explicitly operant or respondent in nature, the dependent variable must be sufficiently operationalized, and the problem must be framed using an operant/respondent conceptualization. The experimental criterion may be met with either single-subject or group-design methods. The dissertation must have been published in a public database (e.g., ProQuest).

## Candidate
An individual who has submitted a certification application.

## Certification Application
An application to apply for certification after eligibility requirements have been met.

## Client
The direct recipient of behavior-analytic services. Other individuals impacted by behavior-analytic services (e.g., parent, caregiver, relative, legally authorized representative, employer) may meet the definition of client when they receive direct training or consultation. In some contexts, the client might be a group of individuals (e.g., with organizational behavior management services).

## Conferral Date
The official date on which your degree was awarded by the institution.

## Continuing Education
Initial BCBA certification indicates that an individual has met entry-level standards of practice as a behavior analyst. The purpose of the BACB's continuing education requirement is to ensure that BCBA certificants engage in activities that will expand their behavior-analytic skills beyond the requirements for initial certification and help them stay up to date on developments in the profession.

## Degree Equivalency Evaluation
This evaluation will be performed as part of your certification application. When we receive your transcript, we will notify you if an evaluation is required. If so, we will provide instructions on how to submit the following documentation:

- An original-source verification (e.g., transcript[s], official statement with course/module grades/marks issued directly by the academic institution) in the original language
- An English translation of the original-source verification
- An official copy of your diploma (i.e., official documentation attesting completion of program and award of degree) from your university in the original language
- An English translation of your official diploma

**Note:** If you received your degree from a university in Cuba, official, signed transcript(s) must be submitted directly from Consultoría Jurídica Internacional (CJI) or Bufete de Servicios Especializados (BES).

In response to differences among members of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) in evaluations, the BACB has decided to use one vendor for all degree equivalency evaluations outside of the US. Currently, that vendor is the Foundation for International Services (FIS).

# GLOSSARY

## Didactic Course
A course that includes synchronous or asynchronous instruction by an instructor.

## Document Version
A document version refers to the version date located in the bottom left corner of each BACB document.

## Documentation System
A documentation system that tracks all ongoing supervision and fieldwork in a way that demonstrates adherence to all relevant requirements and the Code.

## Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts
The document that describes ethics obligations for BCBAs, BCaBAs, applicants, and trainees. All BCBAs, BCaBAs, applicants, and trainees agree to abide by this Code.

## Fieldwork Verification Forms
The forms used by the supervisor and trainee to document fieldwork hours each month (Monthly Fieldwork Verification Form) and at the end of the fieldwork (Final Fieldwork Verification Form). Versions of the forms are provided for individual supervisors as well as organizations with multiple supervisors.

## Group Supervision
An interactive supervision meeting that includes no fewer than 2 and no more than 10 trainees. The number of trainees in a group meeting may not exceed 10 at any time, regardless of the number of supervisors in the meeting.

## Inactive Status
BCBAs may be inactive for the following reasons:

- They are on voluntary inactive or reserve status (i.e., they put a pause on maintaining their certification). To qualify for these options, BCBAs must complete a BCBA Application for Voluntary Inactive Status.
- They did not recertify their BCBA certification and are within their reinstatement period.
- They have disciplinary sanctions against their certification.

BCBAs with an inactive certification may not bill, practice, supervise, or represent themselves as active BCBAs.

## Independent Hours
Fieldwork hours that are accrued when a supervisor is not present.

## Individual Supervisor
An individual supervisor must ensure that all of their trainees' fieldwork requirements are being met during their supervision. In this situation:

- The supervision contract should clearly outline the roles, responsibilities, and expectations for the trainee and supervisor (see the Supervision Contract section)
- All parties are required to sign the supervision contract
- All supervision must be related to specific client programming
- The supervisor must have written permission to receive client information and must be well aware of the organization's values, practices, and personnel; AND
- The person signing the M-FVFs and F-FVF for Individual Supervisors must be able to agree to all of the relevant attestations, including that all fieldwork requirements were met.

## Institutional Accreditation
The recognition by an accrediting agency (i.e., CHEA) that an educational institution as a whole meets established standards of quality and educational effectiveness.

# GLOSSARY

## Multiple Supervisors at One Organization

An organization may coordinate and oversee multiple supervisors who provide fieldwork to a trainee. For example, a service organization might have multiple supervisors providing supervision, or a university might coordinate all on- and off-campus activities under one system. The supervisors must work together to ensure that all of their trainees' fieldwork requirements are met (e.g., all of the hours provided by the supervisors are used to calculate the supervision percentage). One supervisor must ensure that the activity is well organized and coordinated.

In this situation:

- The supervision contract should list all supervisors and clearly outline the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of each supervisor and the trainee (see the Supervision Contract section)
- All parties are required to sign the supervision contract
- All supervision must be related to specific client programming
- The supervisor(s) must have written permission to receive client information and must be well aware of the organization's values, practices, and personnel; AND
- The person signing the M-FVFs and F-FVF for Multiple Supervisors at One Organization (i.e., the responsible supervisor) must be able to agree to all of the relevant attestations, including that all fieldwork requirements were met

## Observation with a Client

The trainee must be observed working with a client in the natural environment during each supervisory period by at least one supervisor. In-person, on-site observation is preferred. However, the observation may be conducted using asynchronous (e.g., recorded video) or synchronous (e.g., live video conference) formats.

## Official Transcripts

Transcripts that are either:

- Electronically sent directly by the institution to the BACB
- Mailed in the original sealed and unopened envelope

Please note that official transcripts become unofficial if the applicant forwards an electronic transcript to the BACB or if the original envelope has been opened. Unofficial transcripts will not be considered in the processing of a certification application.

## Official Translation Service

A service performed by a sworn or certified translator who attaches their signature and stamp to the document to attest that the translation is complete and accurate.

## Ongoing Supervision

Supervision of the services provided by an RBT or BCaBA as one of their requirements to maintain their certification.

## Pathway 2 Program Contact

An active BCBA or BCBA-D in good standing who holds a full-time faculty position in the department where the pathway 2 program is housed.

## Qualifying Coursework

Coursework that must come from a qualifying institution and cover the required content. Only graduate (i.e., master's or doctoral) courses where the applicant was formally enrolled and earned a passing grade ("C" or higher in a graded course or "pass" in a pass/fail system) are acceptable.

## Qualifying Institution

- **United States:** An institution in the US that is listed in the Council for Higher Education Accreditation database
- **Canada:** An educational institution in Canada that is recognized, authorized, registered, or licensed by the Canadian government
- **Australia:** A university in Australia that is registered with the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency

## Recertification Application

The online application that is submitted through a BCBA's BACB account to recertify their BCBA certification on a biennial basis before its expiration date.

## Recertification Date

The date on which a BCBA's certification lapses (the day the BCBA first became certified). BCBAs may locate this date in their BACB account, in the Certificant Registry, and on their certificate.

# GLOSSARY

## Reinstatement Period
If you complete all of your CE requirements but fail to recertify before your recertification date, you will have 30 days from your recertification date to reinstate your certification. After this grace period, you will lose your certification and will need to reapply and meet the eligibility requirements applicable at that time.

## Responsible Supervisor
A supervisor who signs a Fieldwork Verification Form on behalf of an organization where multiple supervisors are providing supervision for one trainee accruing fieldwork hours and who meets supervisor requirements for the entirety of the fieldwork.

## Restricted Activities
The delivery of therapeutic or instructional procedures to a client for those accruing fieldwork hours. Note: Not all time spent working with a client is considered restricted. For example, a number of unrestricted activities may involve the trainee working directly with a client (see Unrestricted Activities).

## Supervised Fieldwork
The experiential activities in which one engages as part of the eligibility requirements for obtaining BCBA (or BCaBA) certification. There are two types of supervised fieldwork: Supervised Fieldwork and Concentrated Supervised Fieldwork. For detailed fieldwork requirements, visit the Supervised Fieldwork Requirements section.

## Supervised Hours
Hours accrued when a supervisor is present. These may include restricted or unrestricted activities observed by a supervisor or individual or group meetings with the supervisor.

## Supervisee
For the purpose of BACB requirements, this includes RBTs and BCaBAs who are receiving supervision from a qualified supervisor (see Trainee).

## Supervisor
A supervisor might supervise trainees who are pursuing BCBA or BCaBA certification (i.e., fieldwork), RBTs who require ongoing supervision, or BCaBAs who require ongoing supervision. BCBAs who are serving as a supervisor must complete an 8-hour supervision training before providing any supervision and may not be related to, subordinate to, or employed by the trainee during the supervisory period. In addition, first-year BCBAs who provide supervision to BCBA or BCaBA trainees accruing fieldwork hours must meet with a consulting supervisor each month in which they provide supervision for the remainder of their first year.

## Supervisor-Trainee Contact
A real-time interaction between the supervisor and trainee that takes place in an individual or group format.

## Task List
A term previously used to describe the knowledge and skills that served as the foundation for the certification examinations.

## Test Content Outline
Identifies the content that will appear on the certification examinations.

## Trainee
Any individual accruing fieldwork toward fulfilling eligibility requirements for BCBA or BCaBA certification.

## Unrestricted Activities
