## Section 2: Quick Phrase- Mnemonics

| Quick Phrase | Meaning |
|---|---|
| “Better than before? Then give ‘em more!” | Differential Reinforcement, perhaps a loose definition here! Better performance = more of the reinforcer/longer time with the reinforcer, etc. Essentially, whatever makes that reinforcer powerful, more of that! |
| “Better performance, better pay” | Differential Reinforcement, perhaps a loose definition here! Better performance = more of the reinforcer/longer time with the reinforcer, etc. Essentially, whatever makes that reinforcer powerful, more of that! |
| “½ Second Rule” | Effective interval for reinforcement of NEW skill. Reinforce immediately! |
| “Teach to the Reach” | In the PECS protocol, during the Correspondence Check, model and prompt the picture of the ITEM the learner is REACHING for when it does NOT match the exchanged picture. |
| “Steps are Essential? Then, it’s Sequential” | Sequential Lesson |
| “Short, sweet, we call it discrete” | Discrete Trial Lesson |
| “Short, sweet, easy to repeat” | Discrete Trial Lesson |
| “Help for the hard part” | In the backstep error correction procedure, we take the learner back to the last correct step and “teach” - by adding a prompt. |
| “Grandma/Grandpa’s Secret” | Similar to building a rapport with a learner. In the beginning, provide nearly free unlimited amounts of the “good stuff” - after being exposed to HIGH rates of getting lots of favorite things from YOU, the learner will likely want to be near you - and thus teaching is easier. |
| “Have a Party!” | A loose way to think about differential reinforcement. |
| “Beat the Prompt” | When utilizing the Progressive Time Delay, this means the learner responded to the Cue and did not need the prompt! |
| “Ooooh the newwwww” skill | Another way to think about the ½ second rule when immediate access to the reinforcer is not possible, because the reinforcer will be delayed due to other behavior that needs to occur before access to the reinforcer can be given. |
| Create and Wait™ | A set of strategies designed to increase communication opportunities. |
| “Never Score Step 4” | In the 4 step EC cycle, Step 4 (Repeat) is not a new trial. It is part of the EC Procedure. So, scoring performance on that step would skew data. |
| “Prompts go away, cues stay!” | Reminder about eliminating prompts and being mindful about the naturally occurring environmental signals/cues that should signal the behavior you are teaching. |
| “Assess, don’t guess!” | Remember that in our framework of the Pyramid Approach to Education®, we cannot assume or presume competence, we must assess. Observable, measurable skills are of utmost importance. |
| “A pic is not a PEC and PECS is not a pic.” | Reminder that PECS is a protocol that teaches functional communication skills, and pictures are used as the modality. |
| “If it’s not PECS, it’s just pictures” | Reminder that PECS is a protocol that teaches functional communication skills, and pictures are used as the modality. Pictures can be used in a variety of other ways for receptive and expressive communication. |
| “If they flip-flop, you must stop” | In Phase IIIB correspondence checks. If the PECS User keeps reaching for the non-corresponding item (but changes the item reached for) in step 4 of the 4-step 2 or 3 times in a row it is best to stop the trial and change focus. |

## Section 3: Glossary/definitions of terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| 2-Person Prompting Procedure | Primarily used when teaching skills involving initiation - such as requesting or asking for help, etc. One person entices with preferred outcome or creates a problem. The second person prompts from behind to ensure the appropriate response. This strategy tends to reduce prompt dependency and errors. |
| 2nd Trainer/physical prompter | A person seated behind or next to the learner. Utilized to teach initiation of communication skills as in PECS Phase I, requesting help, break, tapping a Communication Partner for attention, etc. |
| 4-Step Error Correction/4-Step | Error correction strategy used during discrete lessons, involving four distinct steps to ensure that the response is under appropriate stimulus control. See pages 219-220 in the *Pyramid Approach to Education* Book, 2nd Ed. or see page 128 of the *PECS Training Manual*, 2nd. Ed. for an example. |
| 9 CCS | A set of nine critical communication skills that includes both expressive and receptive skills, that the individual uses to communicate effectively with others and to understand important messages from other people, independent of how the message is delivered. The expressive set includes: asking for reinforcers, help, or for a break as well as answering “Do you want?” yes/no questions. The receptive set includes: functional direction following, transitioning from one activity to another, waiting, calmly reacting when told no, and following a schedule. |
| Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) | “The process of systematically applying interventions based upon the principles of learning theory to improve socially significant behaviors to a meaningful degree and to demonstrate that the interventions employed are responsible for the improvement in behavior.” (Baer, Wolf and Risley, 1968; Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1991)  \n\n“ABA is not something we ‘do’ to learners, it’s a description of how the world works. It is the science of how the world affects the person, how the person affects the world, how the person affects other people, and how the person’s behavior affects the person’s ‘other’ behavior. Much like biology describes the biological world, Behavior Analysis describes the world of behavior. If we have a notion of how these relationships work, it can help us design environments that are conducive to learning. This, in part, is what ABA is.” (Castrogiovanni, 2009) |
| Acquisition | Refers to the early period of time in teaching during which the new behavior is established under narrow circumstances. |
| Additional/Arbitrary/Artificial/Reinforcer | A reinforcer that is not a part of the usual/typical routine (e.g., tokens, money, candy/sweets, an unrelated toy). As with other types of reinforcers, these should be thinned over time and, in optimal situations, more contextually appropriate contingencies will sustain stable rates of the skill or behavior. These reinforcers are added into a situation and are typically different from the reinforcers associated with an activity. For example, going outside would be a typical reinforcer for putting on shoes while saying ‘Nice work’ or giving a token as a reward would be considered ‘arbitrary’ or ‘artificial'. Also known as ‘conditioned reinforcer.’ |
| Alternative Communication | Any device, method, or system used in place of speech for communication. |
| Anticipatory Prompt | In situations when a backstep is not possible or practical, the teacher would alter the next training opportunity and aim to prevent the recurrence of the last error. |
| Apraxia/Verbal Apraxia of Speech | Difficulty coordinating movements in speech production not related to muscle weakness. |
| Assistive Technology | Any tool that is used to improve, increase, or maintain skills. |
| Audio Reinforcement Reminder Tones (ARRT™) | Tones at variable intervals to remind users to reinforce appropriate behaviors. |
| Augmentative Communication | Any device, method, or system used to supplement speech. |
| Autoclitics | A verbal operant defined by Skinner.  \nVerbal behavior that depends upon aspects of the speaker or the conditions associated with communication. For example, in “I really want an apple” really relates to the speaker’s hunger, not the apple itself. Grammatical features also are autoclitics. |
| Backstep Error Correction | Error correction strategy for mistakes in sequential lessons involving re-creating the step prior to the last error made. See pages 220-221 in the *Pyramid Approach to Education*, 2nd Ed. book. Also see page 76 of the *PECS Training Manual*, 2nd Ed. for an example. |
| Backward Chaining | A teaching strategy in which the learner is guided through all of the steps of a behavior sequence, where the prompt is eliminated on the last step first. Once a step is mastered, the lesson focus shifts to the prior step. See page 221 in the *Pyramid Approach to Education* 2nd Ed. book or see page 69 of the *PECS Training Manual*, 2nd Ed. for more information. |
| Behavior Skills Training | A training package that utilizes instructions, modelling, rehearsal, and feedback to teach staff how to teach their learners. Rehearsal and feedback are repeated until mastery criterion is met. |
| Comment | Commenting involves communicating about things/items/events in the world or aspects of those things. The outcome is typically purely social, as in leading to praise or simply continuing the conversation (See tact). |
| Communication Book/Binder | A place to store and organize pictures for the learner to keep and use to communicate throughout the day. |
| Communication Delay | Communication skills are developing according to the typical developmental sequence but are delayed. |
| Communication Disorder | Communication skills are not developing in the typical developmental sequence. Some skills will emerge early, some late, but generally in a scattered pattern when compared to peers of the same age. |
| Communication Domain | Functional domain related to speaking and listening skills (expressive and receptive language skills). |
| Communication Modality | The form of communication a person uses (e.g., pictures, speech, sign language, writing). |
| Communicative Temptations | Strategies for arranging the environment or to increase the likelihood that communication will occur. Ways to “set the stage” for communication. |
| Communication Training Timeline | A suggested sequence for teaching the 9 Critical Communication Skills in relation to the phases of the PECS protocol. |
| Communication Trial vs. Communication Opportunity | Communication trial consists of one communication exchange. For example, request a puzzle piece = 1 trial and 3 requests for puzzle pieces = 3 trials. Any change in the item, communication partner, or setting/activity creates a different opportunity. For example, request a puzzle piece from a different person = a different opportunity. |
| Community Domain | Functional domain including important skills related to greater independence in a wide variety of community settings, including skills such as shopping, using money, aspects of safety, orientation, transportation, crossing the road, attending medical care services, recreation, etc. |
| Conditional Discrimination | A discrimination demonstrating at least two responses controlled by two distinct environmental factors. For example, red truck vs. blue truck AND red pencil vs. blue pencil. |
| Constant Time Delay | Involves inserting a pause at a fixed time interval (e.g., 5 sec) between the cue and the prompt. |
| “Container Lessons” | Using a variety of boxes, bags, pillowcases, etc. in which various reinforcers may be hidden from view (or touch). In such cases, the correct response relates to the appropriate container, not the item within. |
| Core Vocabulary | Words that occur most frequently in expressive communication. The list is not the same as “first” words, but rather refers to words that are used in isolation or in combination with other words. |
| Correspondence Check | A check for conditional discrimination. When a learner requests an item given two or more equally reinforcing items, rather than providing that item the teacher allows the learner to take the item directly. E.g., When a learner requests a ball from an array of preferred toys, and then takes the ball, there is correspondence between the request and the selection. |
| Critical Communication Skills | A list of nine communication skills which are critical regardless of modality; includes both expressive and receptive skills. These include: requesting, requesting a break, requesting assistance, answering yes/no, responding appropriately to “no” and “wait,” direction following, schedule following, and transitioning between activities. |
| Critical Communication Skills Checklist™ | Informal assessment of communication skills including both expressive and receptive skills (https://pecsusa.com/free-materials/). |
| Cue | The event or signal in a situation that typically controls or leads to a specific response. For example, a Stop sign or a question from a server at a restaurant “What do you want to order?” Cues are part of the normal situation and will remain part of the environment. |
| Delayed Prompting | Varying the time between presenting the cue and the prompt. The delay can be constant (i.e., always 5 seconds) or progressive (i.e., increasing over trials from 1 to 5 seconds). |
| Differential Reinforcement | Altering reinforcement levels between two distinct behaviors to promote specific changes in the rate or strength of one behavior. For example, responses following a prompt receive less reinforcement than responses that are independent. |
| Direct Consequences | These reinforcers typically involve material items or activities as opposed to social praise or arbitrary rewards such as money or tokens. |
| Direct/Tangible Reinforcement | The process of strengthening a behavior through consequences. (e.g., receiving a ball, jumping on a trampoline, receiving requested information, avoiding a penalty). |
| Discrete Lessons | Lessons involving short, distinct, repeatable behaviors that are either correct or incorrect depending upon the situation. For example, choosing the correct colour or naming the day of the week. |
| Discrimination | Responding distinctly to different situations. For example, naming cats vs. dogs or Dalmatians vs. Corgis. |
| Domestic Domain | A functional domain including independent living skills across all age groups. This domain can be organized around activities (housekeeping, meal preparation, toileting, taking care of individual equipment, clothes, glasses, etc.), areas of the home (bedroom, kitchen, dining room, etc.) or by time of day (morning routine, bedtime routine, etc.).. |
| Elicited Behavior | Behavior that is largely controlled by something that comes before the action (an antecedent condition). These behaviors are strongly influenced by preceding stimuli and minimally reactive to what follows. For example, jumping and screaming when pricked by a pin or crying when a favorite toy is taken away - these are ‘emotional’ reactions that occur on the first opportunity. |
| Error Correction Cycle | In the 4-Step Error Correction Procedure this refers to going through all 4 steps once. |
| Errorless Teaching | Some people in the field of ABA state that skills (all skills perhaps) can be taught by adding prompts and systematically eliminating those prompts in such a way that the learner never experiences a failure. In our view, this is not possible, as prompts cannot be perfectly eliminated, there exists a chance that an error will occur. No one can guarantee the next change in the lesson will be effective. Teams should be prepared for this and develop an error correction strategy that then seeks to teach. We refer to the goal in the Pyramid Approach as Error Prevention when we insert well planned Teaching/Prompting strategies and eliminate any prompts as quickly as possible. |
| Evidence Based Practice (EBP) | Strategies that are based on an accumulation of evidence involving external scientific evidence garnered from peer reviewed publications. Our clinical judgment may enter this evaluation but should not merely reflect our personal history. Different professional advisory groups have established different criteria/standards for considering what is EBP. |
| Expressive Language | Use of any modality to communicate with another person. |
| Fading | Gradual reduction in the degree of support provided by a prompt. |
| Functionally Equivalent Alternative Behavior (FEAB) | An alternative behavior that serves the same function as the target behavior being reduced/eliminated that also is socially acceptable and safe. For example, using a ‘break’ card instead of hitting one’s head to get out of a task. |
| Fixed Interval (FI) Reinforcement | The next behavior after a set time period results in reinforcement. For example, FI5 minutes means that after a five-minute section of time, the very next response will result in reinforcement. |
| Fixed Ratio (FR) | Reinforcement is given after a constant number of correct responses |
| Fluency | Fluency involves increasing the rate of performance over standard time intervals, essentially combining accuracy plus speed. In a fluency lesson, the learner sets the rate, not the teacher- who sets the pace. |
| Forward Chaining | A teaching strategy in which the learner is initially taught the first step of a sequence and is then guided through the remaining steps. Once the first step is mastered, the second step is taught, and so on, until the performance of the entire sequence is demonstrated. |
| Functional Activities | Functional activities involve skills that are necessary for the development of independence within a society. |
| Functional Communication | “Functional communication involves behavior (defined in form by the community) directed to another person who in turn provides related direct or social rewards.” (Bondy & Frost, 2002) |
| Functional Communication Training (FCT) | Teaching a specific communication skill after determining the function of a problem behavior or Contextually Inappropriate Behavior (CIB). This is not the same as teaching functional communication skills to a learner via a specific modality. |
| Functional Objectives | Functional objectives focus on lessons that are needed to gain greater independence at school, home, and in the community and reflect appropriate materials and age-related expectations. |
| Generalization | The spread of a behavior over a variety of stimuli and the change of the form of the behavior to the same stimuli. These changes may involve conditions associated with the behavior or aspects of the performance itself. One of the main goals of education is the generalization of skills. For example, when reading skills taught in reading class occur in other locations, this change reflects stimulus generalization while increasing the rate of reading reflects response generalization. |
| Guided Access | A strategy for placing a tablet device in a mode where only one application can run until it is taken out of Guided Access. Generally utilized to keep tablets with communication apps in communication mode ONLY. |
| Imitation | Doing what another person just did. For example, tapping a tambourine immediately after someone else taps a tambourine or saying what someone else has just said. |
| Intraverbal | A verbal operant defined by Skinner.  \nA response to, or continuation of, something another person says (e.g., “I’d like a ham omelette” after the server asks, “May I take your order, please.”). Communication that depends upon what someone else has said (or otherwise communicated), but does not depend upon current motivation, something in the immediate environment or is in imitation of the form just said. For example, answering questions such as “How are you?", "Where do you live?" and "What did you do last summer?” or responding to “My favorite movie is X” after someone else has described their own favorite movie. |
| Joint Attention (Joint attention Sharing/Gaze Shift/Shared Referencing) | When a ’speaker‘ shifts attention/gaze to a ‘listener’ while simultaneously reacting to something in the environment. Such actions typically result in either obtaining something (as in a request) or result in a social reaction (as in a comment). |
| Leisure Skills/Leisure Domain | Socially appropriate skills for non-work, non-school time. Examples include reading, playing, listening to music, using a smart phone/tablet, etc. It can be individually or group oriented. |
| Lesson Formats/Lesson Type | Within the Pyramid Approach, we designate two distinct formats- Discrete vs. Sequential. Both lesson formats are essential for all learners. The format of a lesson influences teaching strategies as well as error correction and data collection. |
| Lesson Plan/Instructional Plan | A specific plan describing the key elements necessary to effectively teach a specific skill. In the Pyramid Approach to Education®, these plans cover all elements of the Pyramid and an area for data collection. |
| Mand | A verbal operant defined by Skinner.  \nIt is the root word in both "command" and "demand" in which the antecedent is a state of deprivation (e.g., hunger) or an aversive condition (e.g., rain falling on your head) and the outcome is directly related (food or umbrella). A mand is similar to a request for something specific- either something obtained (e.g., “I want truck”) or something removed (e.g., “Leave me alone!”). |
| Maintenance | Once an objective is mastered, generalization factors remain stable across time. |
| Message Window | The space on a VOCA or SGD that displays the message (words, pictures, or both) that has been constructed. |
| Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) | The average length of the communication determined by the number of morphemes in an utterance. Morphemes can be thought of as the number of words spoken and grammatical markers used. For example, “dogs” contains 2 morphemes: the word “dog” and the plural marker “s”. |
| Mean Length of Sentence Strip (MLSS) | Total number of pictures on each Sentence Strip exchanged, divided by the number of exchanges = the average/mean length of communication of all exchanges. |
| Motivating Operations | Conditions that set the stage for a behavior to occur. |
| Natural/Contextual Reinforcer | A reinforcer that is a typical part of completing a routine or activity (e.g., eating a sandwich or drinking a milkshake immediately after preparation, going outside after putting on a sweater or jacket). This can also be conceptualized as a contextual reinforcer as well since the reinforcer essentially “fits” the context. |
| Negative Punishment | The process of the removal of a stimulus/consequence (generally an unwanted or aversive stimulus/condition) that leads to a weakening/deceleration/decrease in that behavior (often a CIB) in the future. |
| Negative Punisher | The consequence removed after the behavior that leads to a deceleration/decrease in future occurrences of the behavior. |
| Orienting Response | A behavioral response to a change in stimuli such as looking toward something prior to engaging in the next behavior. Some learners need to be taught this skill overtly particularly in Phase IIIA of PECS. If the learner does not orient toward the picture prior to selection, accurate visual discrimination skills may not emerge. |
| Overgeneralisation | Behavior under conditions that are broader than intended. Examples: calling all 4-legged furry animals “dog” or adding the picture “please” at the end of a PECS user Sentence Strip when commenting, e.g., “Look it’s a balloon please.” |
| Partial Task (in teaching) | When teaching sequential lessons, a portion of the sequence is taught instead of all the steps in the final sequence. Often useful when only a portion of the skill needs to be taught or if the other steps can be taught functionally at a later time/after mastery of the portion that is currently the focus. |
| Picture Exchange Communication System® (PECS®) | The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) is a picture-based augmentative/alternative communication system that involves interacting directly with a communication partner by giving a picture or a sequence of pictures. Used by individuals who have no, or limited, functional communication skills. The protocol is evidence-based when taught properly. Research indicates the use of PECS leads to rapidly acquired basic communication skills and may lead to the development of speech and often a reduction in CIBs. |
| Pictures | Visual icons or representations used within PECS from a variety of sources. They may be full colour photographs, line drawings or even product logos. The ‘meaning’ of a picture comes from how it is used. |
| Pivotal Response Training® | A naturalistic, behaviorally based package of strategies designed to teach “pivotal skills” (motivation, response to multiple cues, self-management, and initiation of social interactions) rather than specific skills in order to impact the development of many skills Many strategies within PRT are similar to ones used within PECS. |
| Pivotal Skills | Skills that impact upon sets/groups of other skills. For example, imitation leads to acquiring many other skills, reading can lead to acquiring new information, joint attention leads to observing key changes in the environment, etc. (These other skills pivot around the first skills). |
| Positive Punishment | The process of adding a consequence after a behavior (generally a CIB) that results in a deceleration/decrease in that behavior in the future. |
| Positive Punisher | The consequence added after a behavior that results in a deceleration/decrease in that behavior in the future. |
| Positive Reinforcement | The process of adding a consequence after a behavior that results in an acceleration/increase in that behavior in the future. |
| Positive Reinforcer | The consequence added after a behavior that results in an acceleration/increase in that behavior in the future. |
| Powerful Reinforcer | Powerful reinforcers involve consequences that broadly strengthen many aspects of behavior across a variety of settings and situations. They may involve materials, activities, be social or sensory based. Powerful reinforcement systems involve use of some type of visual information to track important parts of the contract between a teacher and a learner. |
| Preference Assessment | Identifies stimuli that are likely to serve as reinforcers. Refers to a variety of procedures used to determine the stimuli that the person prefers, the relative preference values of those (high versus low preference) and the conditions under which those preference values change when task demands, deprivations states, or schedules of reinforcement are modified. |
| Progressive Time Delay | A strategy that begins by simultaneously presenting both the cue and the prompt. Then, over subsequent trials, gradually increase the delay between presenting the cue and presenting the prompt so that the learner responds to the cue before the prompt is provided. |
| Prompt | Any type of assistance or material modification “help” provided to teach a new skill. For independence to occur, prompts must be eliminated. Prompts may involve physical, spoken, gestural, visual, positional, etc. |
| Prompting Strategies (also known as Teaching Strategies) | The use of a variety of strategies that comprise any “help” added to teach new skills and the systematic removal of this “help” as rapidly as possible so that the learner is responding only to the cue. |
| Punisher | Consequences that lead to the weakening or decrease in a behavior in the future. |
| Pyramid Approach to Education® (PAE) | Also known as ‘Functional ABA.’ A broad-spectrum applied behavior analytic model involving a systematic approach to designing effective learning environments based upon the science of behavior, with a strong emphasis on functional activities and functional communication skills. For more information: https://pecsusa.com/the-pyramid-approach/ |
| Pyramid Certified Classrooms™ | Pyramid Classroom Certification combines comprehensive training and consultative guidance to support education teams in building effective learning environments using the Pyramid Approach to Education®. For more information: https://pecsusa.com/classroom-certification/ |
| Receptive Communication | Listening/direction following skills. |
| Reinforcer | Consequences that lead to the strengthening of a behavior (i.e., it is more likely to occur in the future) are called ‘reinforcers.’ For example, learners are more likely to exchange a picture with a communicative partner if they have received their favorite toy immediately after an exchange. |
| Reinforcer Assessment | Refers to a variety of direct, data-based methods used to present one or more stimuli contingent on a target response and then measuring the future effects on the rate of responding. |
| Request | A communicative behavior that results in tangible or direct outcomes. |
| Response Generalisation | Changing an aspect of a behavior such as its rate, fluency, accuracy, duration, or intensity. These changes may be independent of changes in the immediate circumstances. For example, after learning to put away a single toy, a child learns to put away and properly sort 30 toys within 5 minutes without any help from a teacher: or using 5 different ways of communicating ‘Hello’. |
| Responsive Communication | Responding to the communication of another person. For example, answering the question “What do you want?” See also Intraverbal. |
| Rich Schedule of Reinforcement | Within a lesson, teachers provide more reinforcement early in acquisition as the skill is acquired. Thus, the teacher moves from a rich to a leaner/thinner pattern. |
| SD (Discriminative Stimulus) | Stimuli that strongly suggest a particular behavior will lead to reinforcement. SDs do not physically force or guarantee a particular action to occur but are generally developed via a history of experiencing consequences. For example, the stop sign or traffic light that is red is an SD for stopping. |
| SΔ (S-delta) | Stimuli that suggest a different behavior will lead to reinforcement. Example, the traffic light that is green is an SD for proceeding through the intersection and an SΔ for stopping or not proceeding. |
| Schedules of Reinforcement: In the PAE, also referred to as ‘Patterns of Reinforcement’ | The distribution of rewards for behavior over time. “The schedule of reinforcement for a particular behavior specifies whether every response [continuous] is followed by reinforcement or whether only some responses [variable] are followed by reinforcement.” Miltenberger (2007, p.86) |
| School Based Domain | Functional domain including all academic skills from youngest to oldest learners, from preschool skills to university skills. |
| Self-help Domain | Functional domain including taking care of personal responsibilities associated with eating, dressing, grooming, etc., and personal safety skills at home, at school, and in the community. |
| Sentence Starter | A carrier phrase used to begin communication often consists of two or more words. Examples include "I want," "I see," "I would like," "I have," "It is," "Let's Sing," "The weather is," "My name is." |
| Sentence Strip™ | Part of a PECS Communication Book. The strip upon which pictures are placed in a specific order to build an exchangeable phrase or sentence. |
| Sequential Lessons | Lessons in which a series of steps are taught in a specific order (e.g., riding a bike, making a cup of tea, constructing a sentence). |
| Simple Discrimination | Discrimination where one correct response and at least one incorrect response can be made. For example, in Phase IIIA of PECS 2 pictures are presented where 1 represents the item/activity that is highly preferred and 1 represents something that is non-preferred or contextually irrelevant. |
| Shaping | Systematically using reinforcers to gradually change (shape) new actions beginning with skills already in a learner’s repertoire. These successive approximations to the desired behavior are reinforced as lesser quality demonstrations are no longer reinforced. Shaping may be viewed as ‘teaching without touching.’ Within pure shaping no prompts are utilized and thus there are no prompts to be removed. |
| Social Consequences | Social interaction/feedback provided after a behavior (e.g., praise, continued conversation, attention, a thumbs-up). |
| Social Reinforcement | The process of strengthening a behavior through social consequences. |
| Social Reinforcers | The social consequence added after a behavior that results in an acceleration/increase in that behavior in the future. |
| Speech Generating Device (SGD) | An electronic augmentative or alternative communication device containing recorded or synthesized speech that enables individuals with severe speech impairment to vocally communicate. |
| Tact | A verbal operant defined by Skinner (derived from the word “contact”).  \nVerbal behavior where the antecedent is some aspect of the immediate environment and the consequence is social or educational. Similar to a comment, a label, or a description. For example, “That sunrise is beautiful!” and your communicative partner says, “It certainly is!” |
| Tangible Reinforcers | Concrete consequences (e.g., stickers, toys, food) added after a behavior that results in an acceleration/increase in that behavior in the future. |
| Task Analysis | The steps and the order of steps in a sequential lesson/task. |
| Teacher | Any person teaching another person. |
| Teaching Strategies (also known as Prompting Strategies) | A variety of strategies that comprise the “help” teachers add to teach new skills. The goal is to systematically eliminate any “help” as rapidly as possible until the learner is responding to natural cues only. |
| Variable Interval (VI) | The time interval that needs to pass before a reinforcer is given varies but averages out to a certain time. |
| Variable Ratio (VR) | The reinforcement schedule varies but a reinforcer is given after a varying amount of responses and these average out to a specific number. |
| Visual Reinforcement System | Visually mediated reinforcement system that represents important parts of the contract between a teacher and a learner. (e.g. token board, point system, employer contract) |
| Verbal Behavior by BF Skinner | Skinner’s 1957 book analysing communication and language from a behavior analytic perspective. Verbal behavior is a behavior (defined in form by the community) directed to another person who in turn provides related direct or social rewards. See Chapter 15 of the *PECS Training Manual*, 2nd Ed for more information on PECS and Verbal Behavior. |
| Verbal Behavior | “…behavior reinforced through the mediation of other people…” (p. 2) in which “…the ‘listener’ must be responding in ways which have been conditioned precisely in order to reinforce the behavior of the speaker [by the verbal community]…” This is Skinner’s precise behavior analytic definition of what most would consider ‘communication’ or ‘language.’ In this analysis verbal does NOT mean vocal - it is a much broader term. |
| Whole Task (in teaching) | When teaching a sequential lesson, the entire sequence is presented every time and teaching will focus on previously identified step(s). |
