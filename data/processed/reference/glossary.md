### ABA = APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS

This acronym simply means using the science of behavior-applying it to socially significant behaivors! ABA is an umbrella term that can cover many specific and unique strategies that are all backed up by this science of behavior. ABA is both data-driven and evidence-based.

### ABC DATA = ANTECEDENT-BEHAVIOR-CONSEQUENCE TO FIND THE WHY BEHIND A BEHAVIOR

All 3 of these (antecedent, behavior, consequence) have their own entries in this glossary. These are often collected as ABC data collection to help figure out the function of a behavior, or the WHY behind it.

### ANTECEDENT = WHAT COMES RIGHT BEFORE

This means before a behavior. What happens before a behavior or using an intervention to prevent a problem behavior is called an antecedent intervention. Why? Because it comes BEFORE.

### AUTOMATIC REINFORCEMENT = DOESN'T REQUIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO DELIVER IT TO YOU/ IT FEELS GOOD

Some things just feel good or are reinforcing without anyone else having to give an external reinforcer. Your own behavior produces reinforcement.

### BEHAVIOR = ANYTHING WE SAY OR DO

Technically most BCBAs will say this has to be observable or measurable. But you can also have private behavior which includes your thoughts and feelings.

The Dead Man's Test says that if a dead man can do it then it's not a behavior. Not talking? A dead man can do it. Not hitting? A dead man can do that, too

Behavior typically involves an interaction with the environment. If you say or do something- it puts a new statement or motion into the environment around you.

### BEHAVIOR CONTRACT = A WRITTEN CONTRACT ABOUT BEHAVIOR

It's a physical document also called a contingency contract. You clearly list each party's expectations or target behaviors. Then list out what rewards or reinforcers are available for doing the target behaviors. Each party can sign (the one doing the behaving and the one giving in the reinforcers) and use it as a visual cue or reminder of the contingency happening right now.

### BEHAVIOR SKILLS TRAINING (OR BST) = A WHOLE PACKAGE DEAL OF 4 STEPS TO TEACH A SKILL.

It puts together several research-based practices to pack the best punch. BST is a research-based strategy to teach new skills. It has been defined as "a procedure consisting of instruction, modeling, behavioral rehearsal, and feedback that is used to teach new behaviors or skills" (Miltenberger, 2004).

There are 4 steps to BST. When using this strategy, you can't leave out any of these steps. Do all of them. And do them in order, please.

1. Instructions: tell them.
2. Modeling: show them.
3. Rehearsal: have them show you.
4. Feedback: praise or prompting.

### CHAINING = TEACH ONE STEP IN A SEQUENCE AT A TIME

When teaching larger or more complex skills, teach one step at a time in order. You can start forward or backward- they are both types of chaining. See the entry for task analysis for more.

### CONSEQUENCE = WHAT COMES RIGHT AFTER

I know you want to say a consequence is a negative reaction or punishment but in ABA terms, it's just what comes after. It doesn't mean a negative or positive thing. Just AFTER.

### CONTINGENCY = IF THIS HAPPENS, THEN THAT CAN HAPPEN

A contingency in ABA land usually is a relationship between 2 things. If this happens, then that will happen. If this behavior occurs, then this consequence occurs. It's a pattern of what can happen in the future. See ABC data.

### DIFFERENTIAL REINFORCEMENT = REINFORCING THIS BEHAVIOR INSTEAD OF THAT ONE

Typically you reinforce a desired target behavior while not reinforcing the undesired behavior. You want your child to do THIS (a more effective way to communicate or behave) instead of THAT (problem behavior), so you reinforce THIS and not THAT. There are several specific schedules or procedures within differential reinforcement because it's such a useful teaching tool!

### ECHOIC = EXACT COPY VERBAL BEHAVIOR/ REPEAT

This is a verbal behavior term usually used when teaching verbal behavior. Echoic means echoing. Just repeating back the sounds or words heard.

### ESCAPE = STOP OR GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE

Getting away from something aversive or making that unpleasant stimulus stop. If you don't like something, you get out of it or get away from it. That is escape behavior.

Also goes along with avoidance or negative reinforcement.

### EXTINCTION = STOP THE REINFORCEMENT

To stop a behavior from happening, make sure it's not being reinforced. Stopping a reinforcer to stop a behavior should be accompanied by strong levels of reinforcement for a replacement behavior.

Extinction procedures can have side effects and are not always the most compassionate choice so make sure they are balanced and supported with lots of data.

### FADING = SLOWLY BACKING OFF SUPPORTS

A behavior analyst's goal is always for the learner to do new skills independently. It make take a lot of supports like prompts and visuals and chaining and all kinds of behavior tools you can find in this glossary. Fading is the systematic or purposeful removal of these supports- slowly, gradually, at a pace that works for the learner to keep being successful and do things independently.

### FBA = FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT= FIGURING OUT THE WHY BEHIND A BEHAVIOR

A behavior analyst will take ABC data (antecedent- behavior-consequence) or do an assessment called a functional anlaysis to figure out WHY a behavior is occurring. This is called the function.

If a child is engaging in a problem behavior, we want to replace that with a more appropriate behavior or way of communicating. But the only way this works for a child is if it serves the same purpose, meets the same need, has the same function.

### FUNCTIONAL COMMUNICATION TRAINING = TEACHING HOW TO COMMUNICATE TO PREVENT OR REPLACE PROBLEM BEHAVIOR

An appropriate way to communicate wants and needs is taught and reinforced to replace or prevent problem behavior.

Being able to ask for what you need (in whatever method/ mode) is taught and built up to prevent screaming or hitting or something unhelpful to get what you need.

### GENERALIZATION = FLEXIBLE APPLICATION OF A SKILL

Once a new skill is learned, can it happen in other environments or with other people?

Generalization means the skill generalizes to these other setting or situations.

### INTRAVERBAL = FILL IN THE BLANK OR ANSWER QUESTIONS

A verbal operant with a tricky name. Basically, intraverbals are building blocks to conversation skills as its the ability to discuss, describe, or answer a question about something that isn't physically present. What is your favorite food? Tell me about what you did last weekend.

These are often trained with answering WH questions like who, what, when, where, why or fill in the blanks.

### LATENCY = HOW LONG IT TAKES TO START

The amount of time between a stimulus and a response. For example, when you give an instruction how long does it take for your child to start doing that instruction?

### MAINTENANCE = AFTER A SKILL IS MASTERED, MAKE SURE THEY DON'T LOSE IT; MAINTAIN IT

After a skill is mastered we usually move on to the next skill or next baby step of raised expectations. Maintenance means maintaining previously mastered skills and making sure the learner doesn't just forget them because we stopped practicing them altogether.

Check in every so often to check that skills are maintaining- not forgotten or lost because you moved on.

### MAND = DEMAND OR REQUEST

This means requesting something wanted or needed.

You hear this word with verbal behavior training, it is a verbal operant. Still just means request. Can be spoken or any other form of communication (gestures, sign, picture cues, AAC, etc)

### NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT = INCREASING A BEHAVIOR BY STOPPING SOMETHING UNPLEASANT

This term gets confused by ABA people and parents alike! It does NOT mean a negative consequence.

Reinforcement means the behavior increases. Negative means subtract or take away.

The easiest way to explain: when your car makes a beeping sound until you put your seat belt on. The beeping sound negatively reinforced you wearing a seatbelt. Negative because you stopped or subtracted the beeping sound. Reinforcement because your behavior of seat belt wearing increased.

It's unnecessarily confusing terminology. I'm sorry.

### NET = NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TRAINING = USING REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS

Take advantage of teachable moments in real life instead of creating school-type learning moments. This can look more like playing together and less like sitting across a table with flash cards.

We can say things like "clap your hands" or "touch your head" for instruction following or things like "put on your shoes" and then go play outside in the natural environment.

### NON-CONTINGENT REINFORCEMENT= FREE REINFORCEMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EARNED

Typically with non-contingent reinforcement, it is delivered on a schedule. So the learner gets access to their reinforcers every so often regardless of their behavior. You don't have to earn it- it's just available at these times.

This is an antecedent intervention because it's usually used BEFORE to try to prevent problem behavior.

If I'm getting the attention I'm wanting every so often then I'm less likely to engage in problem behavior to get that attention.

### PAIRING = PAIR SOMETHING UNFUN WITH SOMETHING FUN.

This means to take something reinforcing (the fun) and do it along with the unfun thing (the behavior that isn't happening as often as it could. We do this to help make unfun skills that our kids avoid but are necessary (like brushing teeth) more reinforcing- or more fun!

Pair something reinforcing to your child with something that they aren't a fan of to make the unfun thing more fun.

We are trying to transfer the reinforcing properties of the fun thing to whatever is less desirable to your kiddos. You can pair an activity with reinforcement to make it less stressful.

### PREMACK PRINCIPLE = "FIRST DO THE UNFUN THING, THEN GET A REINFORCER."

"First _____, then _____."

The "first" is an un-fun thing. What is the behavior you need them to do, but they aren't super into it? Next comes the "then". That's the good stuff that you will give them after they complete the un-fun task. The 'then' is the reinforcer.

"First _____, then _____."

Say it out loud. Directly tell them the contingency in place. What are they going to get?

### PROMPT = HELPING OR CUEING TO MAKE A BEHAVIOR HAPPEN

Typically after a behavior has been taught or mastered, then we can give little hints, cues, or help along the way to make it happen in real life.

There are several types of prompts: physical prompt, gestural prompt, position prompt, model prompt, verbal prompt, symbolic prompt, visual prompt, and many more.

This is a type of antecedent intervention- something to do BEFORE to help make a beahvior happen.

## DEFINE

### POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT= SOMETHING IS ADDED AFTER A BEHAVIOR & THEN THAT BEHAVIOR HAPPENS MORE OFTEN IN THE FUTURE.

By definition, positive reinforcement occurs when something is presented immediately following a behavior and as a result, that behavior occurs more often in the future.

Behavior-->Something is added-->behavior occurs more often in the future

Are rewards positive reinforcement? Only if they work to increase the behaviors you want to see more of.

Examples:

Your child tries all the food on their plate at dinner. You give lots of praise and attention. The next night, they try all their food again!

### PREFERENCE ASSESSMENT = WAY TO FIND REINFORCERS

An assessment or test to try to figure out what a learner likes the best that can be used as potential reinforcers to increase a behavior or skill. There are several types of preference assessments. It does what it sounds like- see what is preferred. Can also be a reinforcer assessment.

### PROBE = QUICK TEST A SKILL

Usually just one trial or a first response to see if a skill is mastered already or generalized. It's a quick way to test or assess a specific skill.

### PUNISHMENT = COMES AFTER AND THEN DECREASES A BEHAVIOR

Punishment procedures mean something is either added or taken away from the environment which causes the behavior to DECREASE. That decrease in frequency is what behavior analysts look at the most for punishment.

Punishment should be accompanied by strong reinforcement for a replacement behavior- lots of reinforcement for doing the appropriate behavior instead.

## DEFINE

### REINFORCER = THE THING THAT YOU WANT/ INCREASES THE BEHAVIOR

This is the 'something that is added' following a behavior that causes that behavior to increase (see the positive reinforcement definition). A true reinforcer will cause your child to engage in the desired behaviors again in the future.

Does it increase the behavior? If not- it's not a reinforcer.

Reinforcers are consequences because they come after a behavior.

### SATIATION = HAVING SO MUCH OF SOMETHING THAT IT'S NOT REINFORCING ANY MORE

The common definition of satiation refers to eating. It means being full, not wanting or needing any more food. The same goes for reinforcers. If a learner has had so much of one reinforcer, they don't want or need it anymore. THey are satiated with that reinforcer and it will not be an effective way to teach or shape behavior.

### SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES = IN CHARGE OF YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR CHANGE

There are multiple behavior tools that fall under the self-management umbrella that all have the person in charge of their own behavior change program. Track your own progress, set your own goals, and decide when and how to give yourself access to reinforcement.

## DEFINE

### SHAPING = USING POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT TO BUILD UP BABY STEPS TOWARD THE GOAL.

As one baby step is mastered, you raise the bar to the next step. You stop reinforcing the mastered baby step and move on to the next one to gradually teach a new behavior or skill.

This is used to teach a new skill that is too far out of reach to begin with.

Help them get there gradually by raising the expectation when they are ready.

In jargon terms, this is called reinforcing successive approximations to the target behavior. Successive approximations are the baby steps (in order) to the big picture behavior goal.

### TACT= LABEL

This means being able to label or describe something.

You hear this word with verbal behavior training, it is a verbal operant. Still just means label or identify an object, a smell, a feeling- you name it! Can be spoken or any other form of communication (gestures, sign, picture cues, AAC, etc)

### TASK ANALYSIS = BREAK DOWN ANY ROUTINE OR SKILL TO THE MOST SIMPLE STEPS.

Breaking things down into baby steps and then teaching those baby steps in order can help learn new skills or complete a routine.

Break down any routine or activity to the most simple steps you can think of. Put those in order, list them out, and then either use pictures or words.

We teach each step and can use the list of steps as a visual cue or prompt.

A task analysis is a step-by-step list of actions necessary to complete a specific behavior.

### TOKEN ECONOMY = A STRUCTURED REINFORCEMENT SYSTEM.

A token economy is like a reward system like a sticker chart or marble jar you've seen before. The difference? We are going to be more intentional with it and set it up so that it really works for you.

A behavior change system consisting of three major components: (a) a specified list of target behaviors; (b) tokens or points that participants receive for emitting the target behaviors; and (c) a menu of backup reinforcer items.'

Think of the real economy. You go to work (do a behavior), you get a paycheck (a token). You can then exchange your money (token) to get something you want.

# Section 2: Quick Phrase- Mnemonics

| Mnemonic | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| "Better than before? Then give 'em more!" | Differential Reinforcement, perhaps a loose definition here! Better performance = more of the reinforcer/longer time with the reinforcer, etc. Essentially, whatever makes that reinforcer powerful, more of that! |
| "Better performance, better pay" | Differential Reinforcement, perhaps a loose definition here! Better performance = more of the reinforcer/longer time with the reinforcer, etc. Essentially, whatever makes that reinforcer powerful, more of that! |
| "½ Second Rule" | Effective interval for reinforcement of NEW skill. Reinforce immediately! |
| "Teach to the Reach" | In the PECS protocol, during the Correspondence Check, model and prompt the picture of the ITEM the learner is REACHING for when it does NOT match the exchanged picture. |
| "Steps are Essential? Then, it's Sequential" | Sequential Lesson |
| "Short, sweet, we call it discrete" | Discrete Trial Lesson |
| "Short, sweet, easy to repeat" | Discrete Trial Lesson |
| "Help for the hard part" | In the backstep error correction procedure, we take the learner back to the last correct step and "teach" - by adding a prompt. |
| "Grandma/Grandpa's Secret" | Similar to building a rapport with a learner. In the beginning, provide nearly free unlimited amounts of the "good stuff" - after being exposed to HIGH rates of getting lots of favorite things from YOU, the learner will likely want to be near you - and thus teaching is easier. |
| "Have a Party!" | A loose way to think about differential reinforcement. |
| "Beat the Prompt" | When utilizing the Progressive Time Delay, this means the learner responded to the Cue and did not need the prompt! |
| "Ooooh the newwwww" skill | Another way to think about the ½ second rule when immediate access to the reinforcer is not possible, because the reinforcer will be delayed due to other behavior that needs to occur before access to the reinforcer can be given. |
| Create and Wait™ | A set of strategies designed to increase communication opportunities. |

| "Never Score Step 4" | In the 4 step EC cycle, Step 4 (Repeat) is not a new trial. It is part of the EC Procedure. So, scoring performance on that step would skew data. |
| "Prompts go away, cues stay!" | Reminder about eliminating prompts and being mindful about the naturally occurring environmental signals/cues that should signal the behavior you are teaching. |
| "Assess, don't guess!" | Remember that in our framework of the Pyramid Approach to Education®, we cannot assume or presume competence, we must assess. Observable, measurable skills are of utmost importance. |
| "A pic is not a PEC and PECS is not a pic." | Reminder that PECS is a protocol that teaches functional communication skills, and pictures are used as the modality. |
| "If it's not PECS, it's just pictures" | Reminder that PECS is a protocol that teaches functional communication skills, and pictures are used as the modality. Pictures can be used in a variety of other ways for receptive and expressive communication. |
| "If they flip-flop, you must stop" | In Phase IIIB correspondence checks. If the PECS User keeps reaching for the non-corresponding item (but changes the item reached for) in step 4 of the 4-step 2 or 3 times in a row it is best to stop the trial and change focus. |

# Section 3: Glossary of Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| 2-Person Prompting Procedure | Primarily used when teaching skills involving initiation - such as requesting or asking for help, etc. One person entices with preferred outcome or creates a problem. The second person prompts from behind to ensure the appropriate response. This strategy tends to reduce prompt dependency and errors. |
| 2nd Trainer/physical prompter | A person seated behind or next to the learner. Utilized to teach initiation of communication skills as in PECS Phase I, requesting help, break, tapping a Communication Partner for attention, etc. |
| 4-Step Error Correction/4-Step | Error correction strategy used during discrete lessons, involving four distinct steps to ensure that the response is under appropriate stimulus control. See pages 219-220 in the Pyramid Approach to Education Book, 2nd Ed. or see page 128 of the PECS Training Manual, 2nd. Ed. for an example. |

| 9 CCS | A set of nine critical communication skills that includes both expressive and receptive skills, that the individual uses to communicate effectively with others and to understand important messages from other people, independent of how the message is delivered. The expressive set includes: asking for reinforcers, help, or for a break as well as answering "Do you want?" yes/no questions. The receptive set includes: functional direction following, transitioning from one activity to another, waiting, calmly reacting when told no, and following a schedule. |
| **A** | |
| Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) | "The process of systematically applying interventions based upon the principles of learning theory to improve socially significant behaviors to a meaningful degree and to demonstrate that the interventions employed are responsible for the improvement in behavior." (Baer, Wolf and Risley, 1968; Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1991)<br><br>"ABA is not something we 'do' to learners, it's a description of how the world works. It is the science of how the world affects the person, how the person affects the world, how the person affects other people, and how the person's behavior affects the person's 'other' behavior. Much like biology describes the biological world, Behavior Analysis describes the world of behavior. If we have a notion of how these relationships work, it can help us design environments that are conducive to learning. This, in part, is what ABA is." (Castrogiovanni, 2009) |
| Acquisition | Refers to the early period of time in teaching during which the new behavior is established under narrow circumstances. |
| Additional/Arbitrary/Artificial/ Reinforcer | A reinforcer that is not a part of the usual/typical routine (e.g., tokens, money, candy/sweets, an unrelated toy). As with other types of reinforcers, these should be thinned over time and, in optimal situations, more contextually appropriate contingencies will sustain stable rates of the skill or behavior. These reinforcers are added into a situation and are typically different from the reinforcers associated with an activity. For example, going outside would be a typical reinforcer for putting on shoes while saying 'Nice work' or giving a token as a reward would be considered 'arbitrary' or 'artificial'. Also known as 'conditioned reinforcer.' |

| Alternative Communication | Any device, method, or system used in place of speech for communication. |
| Anticipatory Prompt | In situations when a backstep is not possible or practical, the teacher would alter the next training opportunity and aim to prevent the recurrence of the last error. |
| Apraxia/Verbal Apraxia of Speech | Difficulty coordinating movements in speech production not related to muscle weakness. |
| Assistive Technology | Any tool that is used to improve, increase, or maintain skills. |
| Audio Reinforcement Reminder Tones (ARRT™) | Tones at variable intervals to remind users to reinforce appropriate behaviors. |
| Augmentative Communication | Any device, method, or system used to supplement speech. |
| Autoclitics | A verbal operant defined by Skinner. Verbal behavior that depends upon aspects of the speaker or the conditions associated with communication. For example, in "I really want an apple" really relates to the speaker's hunger, not the apple itself. Grammatical features also are autoclitics. |
| **B** | |
| Backstep Error Correction | Error correction strategy for mistakes in sequential lessons involving re-creating the step prior to the last error made. See pages 220-221 in the Pyramid Approach to Education, 2nd Ed. book. Also see page 76 of the PECS Training Manual, 2nd Ed.for an example. |
| Backward Chaining | A teaching strategy in which the learner is guided through all of the steps of a behavior sequence, where the prompt is eliminated on the last step first. Once a step is mastered, the lesson focus shifts to the prior step. See page 221 in the Pyramid Approach to Education 2nd Ed. book or see page 69 of the PECS Training Manual, 2nd Ed. for more information. |
| Behavior Skills Training | A training package that utilizes instructions, modelling, rehearsal, and feedback to teach staff how to teach their learners. Rehearsal and feedback are repeated until mastery criterion is met. |

| **C** | |
|-------|--|
| Comment | Commenting involves communicating about things/items/events in the world or aspects of those things. The outcome is typically purely social, as in leading to praise or simply continuing the conversation (See tact). |
| Communication Book/Binder | A place to store and organize pictures for the learner to keep and use to communicate throughout the day. |
| Communication Delay | Communication skills are developing according to the typical developmental sequence but are delayed. |
| Communication Disorder | Communication skills are not developing in the typical developmental sequence. Some skills will emerge early, some late, but generally in a scattered pattern when compared to peers of the same age. |
| Communication Domain | Functional domain related to speaking and listening skills (expressive and receptive language skills). |
| Communication Modality | The form of communication a person uses (e.g., pictures, speech, sign language, writing). |
| Communicative Temptations | Strategies for arranging the environment or to increase the likelihood that communication will occur. Ways to "set the stage" for communication. |
| Communication Training Timeline | A suggested sequence for teaching the 9 Critical Communication Skills in relation to the phases of the PECS protocol. |
| Communication Trial vs. Communication Opportunity | Communication trial consists of one communication exchange. For example, request a puzzle piece = 1 trial and 3 requests for puzzle pieces = 3 trials. Any change in the item, communication partner, or setting/activity creates a different opportunity. For example, request a puzzle piece from a different person = a different opportunity. |
| Community Domain | Functional domain including important skills related to greater independence in a wide variety of community settings, including skills such as shopping, using money, aspects of safety, orientation, transportation, crossing the road, attending medical care services, recreation, etc. |

| Conditional Discrimination | A discrimination demonstrating at least two responses controlled by two distinct environmental factors. For example, red truck vs. blue truck AND red pencil vs. blue pencil. |
| Constant Time Delay | Involves inserting a pause at a fixed time interval (e.g., 5 sec) between the cue and the prompt. |
| "Container Lessons" | Using a variety of boxes, bags, pillowcases, etc. in which various reinforcers may be hidden from view (or touch). In such cases, the correct response relates to the appropriate container, not the item within. |
| Core Vocabulary | Words that occur most frequently in expressive communication. The list is not the same as "first" words, but rather refers to words that are used in isolation or in combination with other words. |
| Correspondence Check | A check for conditional discrimination. When a learner requests an item given two or more equally reinforcing items, rather than providing that item the teacher allows the learner to take the item directly. E.g., When a learner requests a ball from an array of preferred toys, and then takes the ball, there is correspondence between the request and the selection. |
| Critical Communication Skills | A list of nine communication skills which are critical regardless of modality; includes both expressive and receptive skills. These include: requesting, requesting a break, requesting assistance, answering yes/no, responding appropriately to "no" and "wait," direction following, schedule following, and transitioning between activities. |
| Critical Communication Skills Checklist™ | Informal assessment of communication skills including both expressive and receptive skills (https://pecsusa.com/freematerials/). |
| Cue | The event or signal in a situation that typically controls or leads to a specific response. For example, a Stop sign or a question from a server at a restaurant "What do you want to order?" Cues are part of the normal situation and will remain part of the environment. |
| **D** | |
| Delayed Prompting | Varying the time between presenting the cue and the prompt. The delay can be constant (i.e., always 5 seconds) or progressive (i.e., increasing over trials from 1 to 5 seconds). |

| Differential Reinforcement | Altering reinforcement levels between two distinct behaviors to promote specific changes in the rate or strength of one behavior. For example, responses following a prompt receive less reinforcement than responses that are independent. |
| Direct Consequences | These reinforcers typically involve material items or activities as opposed to social praise or arbitrary rewards such as money or tokens. |
| Direct/Tangible Reinforcement | The process of strengthening a behavior through consequences. (e.g., receiving a ball, jumping on a trampoline, receiving requested information, avoiding a penalty). |
| Discrete Lessons | Lessons involving short, distinct, repeatable behaviors that are either correct or incorrect depending upon the situation. For example, choosing the correct colour or naming the day of the week. |
| Discrimination | Responding distinctly to different situations. For example, naming cats vs. dogs or Dalmatians vs. Corgis. |
| Domestic Domain | A functional domain including independent living skills across all age groups. This domain can be organized around activities (housekeeping, meal preparation, toileting, taking care of individual equipment, clothes, glasses, etc.), areas of the home (bedroom, kitchen, dining room, etc.) or by time of day (morning routine, bedtime routine, etc.). |
| **E** | |
| Elicited Behavior | Behavior that is largely controlled by something that comes before the action (an antecedent condition). These behaviors are strongly influenced by preceding stimuli and minimally reactive to what follows. For example, jumping and screaming when pricked by a pin or crying when a favorite toy is taken away - these are 'emotional' reactions that occur on the first opportunity. |
| Error Correction Cycle | In the 4-Step Error Correction Procedure this refers to going through all 4 steps once. |

| Errorless Teaching | Some people in the field of ABA state that skills (all skills perhaps) can be taught by adding prompts and systematically eliminating those prompts in such a way that the learner never experiences a failure. In our view, this is not possible, as prompts cannot be perfectly eliminated, there exists a chance that an error will occur. No one can guarantee the next change in the lesson will be effective. Teams should be prepared for this and develop an error correction strategy that then seeks to teach. We refer to the goal in the Pyramid Approach as Error Prevention when we insert well planned Teaching/Prompting strategies and eliminate any prompts as quickly as possible. |
| Evidence Based Practice (EBP) | Strategies that are based on an accumulation of evidence involving external scientific evidence garnered from peer reviewed publications. Our clinical judgment may enter this evaluation but should not merely reflect our personal history. Different professional advisory groups have established different criteria/standards for considering what is EBP. |
| Expressive Language | Use of any modality to communicate with another person. |
| **F** | |
| Fading | Gradual reduction in the degree of support provided by a prompt. |
| Functionally Equivalent Alternative Behavior (FEAB) | An alternative behavior that serves the same function as the target behavior being reduced/eliminated that also is socially acceptable and safe. For example, using a 'break' card instead of hitting one's head to get out of a task. |
| Fixed Interval (FI) Reinforcement | The next behavior after a set time period results in reinforcement. For example, FI5 minutes means that after a five-minute section of time, the very next response will result in reinforcement. |
| Fixed Ratio (FR) | Reinforcement is given after a constant number of correct responses |
| Fluency | Fluency involves increasing the rate of performance over standard time intervals, essentially combining accuracy plus speed. In a fluency lesson, the learner sets the rate, not the teacher- who sets the pace. |

| Forward Chaining | A teaching strategy in which the learner is initially taught the first step of a sequence and is then guided through the remaining steps. Once the first step is mastered, the second step is taught, and so on, until the performance of the entire sequence is demonstrated. |
| Functional Activities | Functional activities involve skills that are necessary for the development of independence within a society. |
| Functional Communication | "Functional communication involves behavior (defined in form by the community) directed to another person who in turn provides related direct or social rewards." (Bondy & Frost, 2002) |
| Functional Communication Training (FCT) | Teaching a specific communication skill after determining the function of a problem behavior or Contextually Inappropriate Behavior (CIB). This is not the same as teaching functional communication skills to a learner via a specific modality. |
| Functional Objectives | Functional objectives focus on lessons that are needed to gain greater independence at school, home, and in the community and reflect appropriate materials and age-related expectations. |
| **G** | |
| Generalization | The spread of a behavior over a variety of stimuli and the change of the form of the behavior to the same stimuli. These changes may involve conditions associated with the behavior or aspects of the performance itself. One of the main goals of education is the generalization of skills. For example, when reading skills taught in reading class occur in other locations, this change reflects stimulus generalization while increasing the rate of reading reflects response generalization. |
| Guided Access | A strategy for placing a tablet device in a mode where only one application can run until it is taken out of Guided Access. Generally utilized to keep tablets with communication apps in communication mode ONLY. |
| **I** | |
| Imitation | Doing what another person just did. For example, tapping a tambourine immediately after someone else taps a tambourine or saying what someone else has just said. |

| Intraverbal | A verbal operant defined by Skinner. A response to, or continuation of, something another person says (e.g., "I'd like a ham omelette" after the server asks, "May I take your order, please."). Communication that depends upon what someone else has said (or otherwise communicated), but does not depend upon current motivation, something in the immediate environment or is in imitation of the form just said. For example, answering questions such as "How are you?", "Where do you live?" and "What did you do last summer?" or responding to "My favorite movie is X" after someone else has described their own favorite movie. |
| **J** | |
| Joint Attention (Joint attention Sharing/Gaze Shift/Shared Referencing) | When a 'speaker' shifts attention/gaze to a 'listener' while simultaneously reacting to something in the environment. Such actions typically result in either obtaining something (as in a request) or result in a social reaction (as in a comment). |
| **L** | |
| Leisure Skills/Leisure Domain | Socially appropriate skills for non-work, non-school time. Examples include reading, playing, listening to music, using a smart phone/tablet, etc. It can be individually or group oriented. |
| Lesson Formats/Lesson Type | Within the Pyramid Approach, we designate two distinct formats: Discrete vs. Sequential. Both lesson formats are essential for all learners. The format of a lesson influences teaching strategies as well as error correction and data collection. |
| Lesson Plan/Instructional Plan | A specific plan describing the key elements necessary to effectively teach a specific skill. In the Pyramid Approach to Education®, these plans cover all elements of the Pyramid and an area for data collection. |
| **M** | |
| Mand | A verbal operant defined by Skinner. It is the root word in both "command" and "demand" in which the antecedent is a state of deprivation (e.g., hunger) or an aversive condition (e.g., rain falling on your head) and the outcome is directly related (food or umbrella). A mand is similar to a request for something specific- either something obtained (e.g., "I want truck") or something removed (e.g., "Leave me alone!"). |

| Maintenance | Once an objective is mastered, generalization factors remain stable across time. |
| Message Window | The space on a VOCA or SGD that displays the message (words, pictures, or both) that has been constructed. |
| Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) | The average length of the communication determined by the number of morphemes in an utterance. Morphemes can be thought of as the number of words spoken and grammatical markers used. For example, "dogs" contains 2 morphemes: the word "dog" and the plural marker "s". |
| Mean Length of Sentence Strip (MLSS) | Total number of pictures on each Sentence Strip exchanged, divided by the number of exchanges = the average/mean length of communication of all exchanges. |
| Motivating Operations | Conditions that set the stage for a behavior to occur. |
| **N** | |
| Natural/Contextual Reinforcer | A reinforcer that is a typical part of completing a routine or activity (e.g., eating a sandwich or drinking a milkshake immediately after preparation, going outside after putting on a sweater or jacket). This can also be conceptualized as a contextual reinforcer as well since the reinforcer essentially "fits" the context. |
| Negative Punishment | The process of the removal of a stimulus/consequence (generally an unwanted or aversive stimulus/condition) that leads to a weakening/deceleration/decrease in that behavior (often a CIB) in the future. |
| Negative Punisher | The consequence removed after the behavior that leads to a deceleration/decrease in future occurrences of the behavior. |
| **O** | |
| Orienting Response | A behavioral response to a change in stimuli such as looking toward something prior to engaging in the next behavior. Some learners need to be taught this skill overtly particularly in Phase IIIA of PECS. If the learner does not orient toward the picture prior to selection, accurate visual discrimination skills may not emerge. |
| Overgeneralisation | Behavior under conditions that are broader than intended. Examples: calling all 4-legged furry animals "dog" or adding the picture "please" at the end of a PECS user Sentence Strip when commenting, e.g., "Look it's a balloon please." |

| **P** | |
|-------|--|
| Partial Task (in teaching) | When teaching sequential lessons, a portion of the sequence is taught instead of all the steps in the final sequence. Often useful when only a portion of the skill needs to be taught or if the other steps can be taught functionally at a later time/after mastery of the portion that is currently the focus. |
| Picture Exchange Communication System® (PECS®) | The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) is a picture-based augmentative/alternative communication system that involves interacting directly with a communication partner by giving a picture or a sequence of pictures. Used by individuals who have no, or limited, functional communication skills. The protocol is evidence-based when taught properly. Research indicates the use of PECS leads to rapidly acquired basic communication skills and may lead to the development of speech and often a reduction in CIBs. |
| Pictures | Visual icons or representations used within PECS from a variety of sources. They may be full colour photographs, line drawings or even product logos. The 'meaning' of a picture comes from how it is used. |
| Pivotal Response Training® | A naturalistic, behaviorally based package of strategies designed to teach "pivotal skills" (motivation, response to multiple cues, self-management, and initiation of social interactions) rather than specific skills in order to impact the development of many skills Many strategies within PRT are similar to ones used within PECS. |
| Pivotal Skills | Skills that impact upon sets/groups of other skills. For example, imitation leads to acquiring many other skills, reading can lead to acquiring new information, joint attention leads to observing key changes in the environment, etc. (These other skills pivot around the first skills). |
| Positive Punishment | The process of adding a consequence after a behavior (generally a CIB) that results in a deceleration/decrease in that behavior in the future. |
| Positive Punisher | The consequence added after a behavior that results in a deceleration/decrease in that behavior in the future. |
| Positive Reinforcement | The process of adding a consequence after a behavior that results in an acceleration/increase in that behavior in the future. |

| Positive Reinforcer | The consequence added after a behavior that results in an acceleration/increase in that behavior in the future. |
| Powerful Reinforcer | Powerful reinforcers involve consequences that broadly strengthen many aspects of behavior across a variety of settings and situations. They may involve materials, activities, be social or sensory based. Powerful reinforcement systems involve use of some type of visual information to track important parts of the contract between a teacher and a learner. |
| Preference Assessment | Identifies stimuli that are likely to serve as reinforcers. Refers to a variety of procedures used to determine the stimuli that the person prefers, the relative preference values of those (high versus low preference) and the conditions under which those preference values change when task demands, deprivations states, or schedules of reinforcement are modified. |
| Progressive Time Delay | A strategy that begins by simultaneously presenting both the cue and the prompt. Then, over subsequent trials, gradually increase the delay between presenting the cue and presenting the prompt so that the learner responds to the cue before the prompt is provided. |
| Prompt | Any type of assistance or material modification "help" provided to teach a new skill. For independence to occur, prompts must be eliminated. Prompts may involve physical, spoken, gestural, visual, positional, etc. |
| Prompting Strategies (also known as Teaching Strategies) | The use of a variety of strategies that comprise any "help" added to teach new skills and the systematic removal of this "help" as rapidly as possible so that the learner is responding only to the cue. |
| Punisher | Consequences that lead to the weakening or decrease in a behavior in the future. |
| Pyramid Approach to Education® (PAE) | Also known as 'Functional ABA.' A broad-spectrum applied behavior analytic model involving a systematic approach to designing effective learning environments based upon the science of behavior, with a strong emphasis on functional activities and functional communication skills.

| **R** | |
| Receptive Communication | Listening/direction following skills. |
| Reinforcer | Consequences that lead to the strengthening of a behavior (i.e., it is more likely to occur in the future) are called 'reinforcers.' For example, learners are more likely to exchange a picture with a communicative partner if they have received their favorite toy immediately after an exchange. |
| Reinforcer Assessment | Refers to a variety of direct, data-based methods used to present one or more stimuli contingent on a target response and then measuring the future effects on the rate of responding. |
| Request | A communicative behavior that results in tangible or direct outcomes. |
| Response Generalisation | Changing an aspect of a behavior such as its rate, fluency, accuracy, duration, or intensity. These changes may be independent of changes in the immediate circumstances. For example, after learning to put away a single toy, a child learns to put away and properly sort 30 toys within 5 minutes without any help from a teacher: or using 5 different ways of communicating 'Hello'. |
| Responsive Communication | Responding to the communication of another person. For example, answering the question "What do you want?" See also Intraverbal. |
| Rich Schedule of Reinforcement | Within a lesson, teachers provide more reinforcement early in acquisition as the skill is acquired. Thus, the teacher moves from a rich to a leaner/thinner pattern. |
| **S** | |
| SD Discriminative Stimulus: | Stimuli that strongly suggest a particular behavior will lead to reinforcement. SDs do not physically force or guarantee a particular action to occur but are generally developed via a history of experiencing consequences. For example, the stop sign or traffic light that is red is an SD for stopping. |

| SΔ S-delta: | Stimuli that suggest a different behavior will lead to reinforcement. Example, the traffic light that is green is an SD for proceeding through the intersection and an SΔ for stopping or not proceeding. |
| Schedules of Reinforcement: In the PAE, also referred to as 'Patterns of Reinforcement' | The distribution of rewards for behavior over time. "The schedule of reinforcement for a particular behavior specifies whether every response [continuous] is followed by reinforcement or whether only some responses [variable] are followed by reinforcement." Miltenberger (2007, p.86) |
| School Based Domain | Functional domain including all academic skills from youngest to oldest learners, from preschool skills to university skills. |
| Self-help Domain | Functional domain including taking care of personal responsibilities associated with eating, dressing, grooming, etc., and personal safety skills at home, at school, and in the community. |
| Sentence Starter | A carrier phrase used to begin communication often consists of two or more words. Examples include "I want," "I see," "I would like," "I have," "It is," "Let's Sing," "The weather is," "My name is." |
| Sentence Strip™ | Part of a PECS Communication Book. The strip upon which pictures are placed in a specific order to build an exchangeable phrase or sentence. |
| Sequential Lessons | Lessons in which a series of steps are taught in a specific order (e.g., riding a bike, making a cup of tea, constructing a sentence). |
| Simple Discrimination | Discrimination where one correct response and at least one incorrect response can be made. For example, in Phase IIIA of PECS 2 pictures are presented where 1 represents the item/activity that is highly preferred and 1 represents something that is non-preferred or contextually irrelevant. |
| Shaping | Systematically using reinforcers to gradually change (shape) new actions beginning with skills already in a learner's repertoire. These successive approximations to the desired behavior are reinforced as lesser quality demonstrations are no longer reinforced. Shaping may be viewed as 'teaching without touching.' Within pure shaping no prompts are utilized and thus there are no prompts to be removed. |
| Social Consequences | Social interaction/feedback provided after a behavior (e.g., praise, continued conversation, attention, a thumbs-up). |

| Social Reinforcement | The process of strengthening a behavior through social consequences. |
| Social Reinforcers | The social consequence added after a behavior that results in an acceleration/increase in that behavior in the future. |
| Speech Generating Device (SGD) | An electronic augmentative or alternative communication device containing recorded or synthesized speech that enables individuals with severe speech impairment to vocally communicate. |
| **T** | |
| Tact | A verbal operant defined by Skinner (derived from the word "contact"). Verbal behavior where the antecedent is some aspect of the immediate environment and the consequence is social or educational. Similar to a comment, a label, or a description. For example, "That sunrise is beautiful!" and your communicative partner says, "It certainly is!" |
| Tangible Reinforcers | Concrete consequences (e.g., stickers, toys, food) added after a behavior that results in an acceleration/increase in that behavior in the future. |
| Task Analysis | The steps and the order of steps in a sequential lesson/task. |
| Teacher | Any person teaching another person. |
| Teaching Strategies (also known as Prompting Strategies) | A variety of strategies that comprise the "help" teachers add to teach new skills. The goal is to systematically eliminate any "help" as rapidly as possible until the learner is responding to natural cues only. |
| **V** | |
| Variable Interval (VI) | The time interval that needs to pass before a reinforcer is given varies but averages out to a certain time. |
| Variable Ratio (VR) | The reinforcement schedule varies but a reinforcer is given after a varying amount of responses and these average out to a specific number. |
| Visual Reinforcement System | Visually mediated reinforcement system that represents important parts of the contract between a teacher and a learner. (e.g. token board, point system, employer contract) |

| Verbal Behavior by BF Skinner | Skinner's 1957 book analysing communication and language from a behavior analytic perspective. Verbal behavior is a behavior (defined in form by the community) directed to another person who in turn provides related direct or social rewards. See Chapter 15 of the PECS Training Manual, 2nd Ed for more information on PECS and Verbal Behavior. |
| Verbal Behavior | "…behavior reinforced through the mediation of other people…" (p. 2) in which "…the 'listener' must be responding in ways which have been conditioned precisely in order to reinforce the behavior of the speaker [by the verbal community]…" This is Skinner's precise behavior analytic definition of what most would consider 'communication' or 'language.' In this analysis verbal does NOT mean vocal - it is a much broader term. |
| **W** | |
| Whole Task (in teaching) | When teaching a sequential lesson, the entire sequence is presented every time and teaching will focus on previously identified step(s). |
