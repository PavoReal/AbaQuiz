## Overview

This curriculum outline is comprised of learning objectives, tasks, and considerations that are important for creating an effective supervisory relationship. Supervisors who oversee the work of (a) individuals acquiring fieldwork (i.e., experience¹) for BCBA or BCaBA certification (trainees) and (b) current BCaBA or RBT certificants who are required to have ongoing supervision (supervisees) are required to complete an 8-hour supervision training based on this curriculum before providing any supervision. Supervisors, supervisees, and trainees should confirm the date the supervisor completed the training prior to initiating the supervisor relationship.

## Requirements for Training Providers

All Authorized Continuing Education (ACE) Providers are eligible to offer supervision training based on this curriculum outline. The cumulative duration of training must be at least 8 hours (but may be offered in units as brief as 1 hour). The training activities must include opportunities for trainees to demonstrate verbal or practical competence of the curricular areas below. Training may be conducted in person or online. The training may be completed up to 180 days prior to the learner's² original BACB certification date.

## Requirements for Documentation

ACE Providers must provide the learner with a one-page document showing that the learner completed the full training (see the ACE Handbook for documentation requirements). The training provided must include a link to the BACB Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline (2.0), as well as the following text in all online and print materials for their training program:

"This training program is based on the BACB Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline (2.0) but is offered independent of the BACB."

The learner must upload the documentation described above into their BACB account. Once the documentation has been approved and they meet all other relevant supervision eligibility requirements, they may begin providing supervision.

¹ The term fieldwork will be used throughout this document to refer to the supervised practical experience required for obtaining BCBA or BCaBA certification.

² We are using the term learner in this document to refer to those who are taking the supervision training.
