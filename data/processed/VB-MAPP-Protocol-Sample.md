# VB-MAPP

## Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program

This Protocol is designed to accompany the VB-MAPP Guide (Sundberg, 2008, 2014). The Guide contains the general instructions and scoring criteria for completing the VB-MAPP Protocol. The Guide also provides placement recommendations for each of the 170 milestones along with suggestions for IEP goals. In addition, the Guide contains a brief description of the basic components of a behavioral approach to language, and definitions and examples of the skills and barriers assessed in the VB-MAPP (i.e., mand, tact, intraverbal, scrolling). In order to gain the maximum benefit from the VB-MAPP, it is essential that the assessor use the VB-MAPP Guide. In addition, it is important that the assessor be familiar with behavior analysis, and a behavioral approach to language.

The VB-MAPP is based on B.F. Skinner’s (1957) analysis of verbal behavior, developmental milestones, and field-test data from typically developing children, children with autism, and children with other developmental disabilities. Over the course of several years, speech pathologists, behavior analysts, psychologists, special education teachers, occupational therapists, and parents of children with special needs have provided additional input.

There are five components of the VB-MAPP¹. The first part is the VB-MAPP Milestones Assessment, which constitutes the core of the program. It is designed to provide a representative sample of a child’s existing verbal and related skills. The Milestones Assessment contains 170 measurable Milestones that are balanced across 16 skill areas, and 3 developmental levels (0-18 months, 18-30 months, and 30-48 months).

The second part is the VB-MAPP Barriers Assessment, which provides an assessment of 24 learning and language acquisition barriers often faced by children with language delays.

The third part is the VB-MAPP Transition Assessment, which provides an overall summary assessment of a child’s readiness to move to a less restrictive educational setting.

The fourth part is the VB-MAPP Task Analysis and Supporting Skills. The task analysis skills are directly related to the target milestones and represent earlier steps in reaching those milestones. The supporting skills supplement the milestones with language, learning, and social skills that should be developed along with the milestones. The supporting skills are not necessarily prerequisites for a specific milestone, or need to be worked on in the exact order that they are presented. Nonetheless, the supporting skills contained in this section of the Protocol are an essential part of any intervention program. The supporting skills are identified in this section of the Protocol with an asterisk (*).

The final component of the overall program is the VB-MAPP Placement and IEP Goals, which is not contained in the Protocol, but is contained in the VB-MAPP Guide. Once a child’s skills and barriers have been identified and analyzed, IEP goals can be written and an intervention program can be designed and implemented to meet those goals. Supplemental materials for the VB-MAPP can be found at www.avbpress.com.
