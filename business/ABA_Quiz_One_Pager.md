## Your BCBA Exam Study Buddy — Right in Your Pocket

Studying for the BCBA exam is hard enough without having to carve out hours of dedicated study time. Between supervision hours, coursework, and life, who has time to sit down with flashcards every day?

That's where ABA Quiz comes in. We bring the study session to you — two practice questions delivered straight to your Telegram, every single day. Morning coffee? Quiz time. Evening commute? Quiz time. No apps to open, no schedules to keep. Just tap, answer, and learn.

## What Makes ABA Quiz Different

**Built around your schedule, not the other way around**
You don't need to remember to study. We'll remind you. Two questions a day keeps the knowledge fresh without overwhelming your already-packed schedule.

**Questions that actually help**
Our questions are generated using AI trained on official BCBA study materials — the Task List, ethics code, and more. No random trivia. Just relevant, exam-focused practice.

**Gamification that keeps you going**
Maintain your streak. Earn achievements. Compete with yourself. We've built in the little nudges that help you stay consistent — because consistency is what passes exams.

**Focus on what you need most**
Struggling with ethics? Measurement giving you trouble? Set your focus areas and get more questions where you need them.
